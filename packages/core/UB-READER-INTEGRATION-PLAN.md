# UB Reader Integration Plan

This document outlines the plan for integrating the Core Package into the UB Reader application.

## Overview

The Core Package provides the foundation for the UB Reader application, including document models, navigation, selection, and extension systems. The next step is to integrate these components into the UB Reader application to create a complete reading experience.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Set Up Project Structure

- Create a new Next.js application for the UB Reader
- Install the Core Package as a dependency
- Configure TypeScript and other development tools
- Set up the project structure following best practices

### 2. Implement Core Components

- Create a main Reader component that uses the ReaderProvider
- Implement the navigation UI components
- Create the content display components
- Implement the selection and highlighting UI

### 3. Develop UB-Specific Features

- Implement UB-specific document rendering
- Create paper and section navigation
- Add reference linking and tooltips
- Implement cross-reference functionality

### 4. Create Extensions

- Develop a scientific content extension
- Create a commentary extension
- Implement a search extension
- Add a bookmarking extension

### 5. Implement Theme System

- Create UB-specific themes (traditional, scientific, etc.)
- Implement theme switching UI
- Add customization options for themes
- Ensure proper styling for all components

### 6. Add Content Repository

- Implement content loading from a repository
- Add caching for offline access
- Create content indexing for search
- Implement content updates

### 7. Optimize Performance

- Implement virtualization for large documents
- Add lazy loading for content
- Optimize rendering performance
- Implement efficient state management

### 8. Add User Features

- Create user accounts and authentication
- Implement user preferences
- Add synchronization for user data
- Create sharing functionality

### 9. Testing and Quality Assurance

- Write unit tests for all components
- Implement integration tests
- Perform performance testing
- Conduct accessibility testing

### 10. Deployment

- Configure deployment pipeline
- Set up continuous integration
- Implement monitoring and analytics
- Create release process

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Description              | Timeline    |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1     | Initial Setup            | Week 1      |
| 2     | Core Components          | Weeks 2-3   |
| 3     | UB-Specific Features     | Weeks 4-5   |
| 4     | Extensions               | Weeks 6-7   |
| 5     | Theme System             | Week 8      |
| 6     | Content Repository       | Weeks 9-10  |
| 7     | Performance Optimization | Week 11     |
| 8     | User Features            | Weeks 12-13 |
| 9     | Testing and QA           | Week 14     |
| 10    | Deployment               | Week 15     |

## Technical Considerations

### State Management

The Core Package provides a React context for state management. For more complex state requirements, consider using:

- React Context for component-level state
- Redux for application-wide state
- React Query for server state

### Performance

For optimal performance:

- Use virtualization for large documents
- Implement memoization for expensive computations
- Optimize rendering with React.memo and useMemo
- Use code splitting to reduce bundle size

### Accessibility

Ensure the application is accessible:

- Use semantic HTML
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Add ARIA attributes
- Support screen readers

### Browser Compatibility

Support modern browsers:

- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Consider polyfills for older browsers

## Extension Development

The Core Package provides an extension system for adding new functionality. To create new extensions:

1. Define the extension manifest
2. Implement the extension initialization
3. Create any necessary components
4. Register hooks for integration points

Example:

```tsx
import { createExtension, ExtensionType } from '@ub-ecosystem/core';

const searchExtension = createExtension(
  {
    id: 'search-extension',
    name: 'Search Extension',
    version: '1.0.0',
    type: ExtensionType.FEATURE,
    description: 'Adds search functionality to the reader',
  },
  (context, api) => {
    // Initialize the extension
    api.registerComponent('toolbar', SearchToolbarButton);
    api.registerComponent('sidebar', SearchPanel);
  }
);
```

## Conclusion

The Core Package provides a solid foundation for building the UB Reader application. By following this integration plan, we can create a feature-rich, performant, and accessible reading experience for users.

The modular architecture of the Core Package allows for flexibility and extensibility, making it easy to add new features and customize the application to meet the specific needs of the UB Reader.
