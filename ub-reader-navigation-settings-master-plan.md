## Component Architecture

The component architecture diagrams illustrate the structure and interactions of the enhanced Reader components.

### Component Hierarchy

The Reader component hierarchy shows the relationship between components:

- Reader Component
  - ReaderHeader
    - ReaderNavigation
    - ReaderSettings
    - ReaderTitle
  - ReaderMain
    - ReaderContent

### Component Interactions

The component interactions diagram shows how components communicate:

- User interactions trigger component methods
- Components update shared state
- State changes propagate to affected components

### Data Flow

The data flow diagram shows how data moves through the system:

- Document model flows to navigation and content
- Configuration flows to settings and content
- User actions update configuration and navigation state

## UI Specifications

The UI specifications provide detailed guidance for the visual and interactive aspects of the navigation and settings components.

### Navigation Component

- Hamburger menu button in header
- Slide-in navigation panel
- Part toggle with expand/collapse
- Paper list with active highlighting
- Section dropdown for quick navigation

### Settings Component

- Gear icon in header
