# VS Code Issues Resolution Summary

## What We've Done

1. **Created VS Code Configuration Files**:

   - `.vscode/settings.json` - Configured TypeScript formatter settings
   - `.vscode/extensions.json` - Recommended extensions for the project
   - `.prettierrc` - Prettier formatting configuration

2. **Created Diagnostic Script**:

   - `scripts/clean-vscode-tabs.ps1` - Script to identify non-existent files in VS Code tabs

3. **Identified the Issue**:
   - All open tabs in VS Code reference files that no longer exist
   - These files have been migrated to new locations during the repository restructuring
   - VS Code is trying to work with these non-existent files, causing the "strange loop" issue

## What You Need to Do Next

1. **Close VS Code Completely**:

   - Save any unsaved work
   - Close all VS Code windows
   - Exit VS Code completely

2. **Reopen VS Code**:

   - Open VS Code
   - Open the project again
   - This will refresh VS Code's file cache and state

3. **Verify the TypeScript Formatter Issue is Resolved**:

   - Open a TypeScript file
   - Check if the TypeScript formatter conflict message still appears
   - If it does, you may need to select a default formatter when prompted

4. **Continue with the Repository Cleanup Plan**:
   - Follow the next steps outlined in `next-steps-implementation-plan.md`
   - Focus on package development as discussed

## File Migration Reference

The following files have been migrated:

| Original Location               | New Location                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `src/lib/document-transformer/` | `packages/content-transformer/src/` |
| `src/components/`               | `packages/ui/src/`                  |
| `src/tina/`                     | Various packages                    |
| `src/app/`                      | `sandbox/app/`                      |

## Additional Notes

- The TypeScript formatter conflict should be resolved by the `.vscode/settings.json` file we created
- If you encounter any other VS Code issues after restarting, please let me know
- The repository cleanup plan documents provide comprehensive guidance for the next steps in the cleanup process
