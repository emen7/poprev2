# Project Appraisal - PopRev2

## Repository Structure Overview

The repository has been restructured to follow a modern monorepo architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Top-Level Directories

- **apps/** - Application implementations

  - **almanac-new/** - New almanac application (renamed from almanac)
  - **publications/** - Publications application
  - **reader/** - UB Reader application with content in apps/reader/content/ub-json

- **packages/** - Shared libraries and components

  - **audio-services/** - Audio playback services
  - **config/** - Shared configuration
  - **content-transformer/** - Document transformation utilities
  - **data-models/** - Shared data models
  - **reference-parser/** - Reference parsing utilities
  - **table-transformer/** - Table transformation utilities
  - **ui/** - Shared UI components

- **sandbox/** - Examples and prototypes

  - **almanac-reference/** - Reference material for the almanac (moved from root)
  - **app/** - Example pages and applications
  - **components/** - Example components
  - **lib/** - Example utilities
  - **tina/** - TinaCMS configuration and examples

- **content/** - Shared content files

  - **raw/** - Raw content files
  - **scientific/** - Scientific content

- **docs/** - Documentation

  - **architecture/** - Architecture documentation
  - **archive/** - Archived documentation
  - **deployment/** - Deployment guides
  - **development/** - Development guides

- **src/** - Legacy directory (to be fully migrated)
  - Still contains components, utilities, and pages that need to be migrated

### Key Documentation

1. **docs/almanac-structure-clarification.md** - Explains the almanac structure and content organization
2. **docs/reader-architecture-clarification.md** - Explains the reader component architecture
3. **docs/architecture/** - Contains architecture plans and documentation

## Current State Assessment

### Accomplishments

1. **Improved Directory Structure**

   - Created a clear monorepo structure with apps, packages, and sandbox
   - Moved documentation to docs directory
   - Created a sandbox for examples and prototypes

2. **Reduced Duplication**

   - Eliminated duplicate UB JSON files
   - Consolidated almanac reference material in sandbox

3. **Clarified Component Architecture**

   - Established clear distinction between generic reader component and specific reader applications
   - Documented the relationship between components

4. **Improved Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive documentation for the architecture
   - Added clarification documents for key components

### Remaining Work

1. **Complete Src Migration**

   - The src directory still contains components, utilities, and pages that need to be migrated
   - Need to update imports in all files to reference the new locations

2. **Implement Publication-Specific Readers**

   - Need to implement readers for Scientific, Lectionary, Catechism, and PopRev publications
   - Each should use the generic reader component with publication-specific customizations

3. **Update Build Configuration**

   - Need to ensure build configuration works with the new structure
   - May need to update package.json files and dependencies

4. **Testing**
   - Need to test all components and applications in the new structure
   - Ensure that everything works correctly after migration

## Git Branch Status

- Currently on the **repo-cleanup-dev** branch
- This branch contains all the repository structure refinements
- The main branch has not been updated with these changes yet

## Recommendations

1. **Complete Src Migration**

   - Finish migrating all components, utilities, and pages from src to their appropriate locations
   - Update all imports to reference the new locations
   - Remove the src directory once migration is complete

2. **Merge to Main**

   - Once all tests pass, merge the repo-cleanup-dev branch to main
   - This will make the new structure available to all developers

3. **Create Feature Branches**

   - Create feature branches for implementing publication-specific readers
   - Each publication should have its own branch for development

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Continue to update documentation as the project evolves
   - Ensure that all developers understand the new structure

## Next Steps

1. **Implement UB Reader**

   - Focus on completing the UB Reader application
   - This will serve as a reference for other publication readers

2. **Develop Publication Readers**

   - Implement readers for Scientific, Lectionary, Catechism, and PopRev
   - Each should have its own branding and customizations

3. **Integrate with Content Sources**

   - Connect readers to their respective content sources
   - Ensure that content is properly transformed and displayed

4. **Deploy and Test**
   - Deploy applications for testing
   - Gather feedback and make improvements
