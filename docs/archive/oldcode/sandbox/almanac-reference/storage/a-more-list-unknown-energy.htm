		<span>Of all the divine attributes, his omnipotence, especially as it prevails in the

		energy. This declaration of physical fact is predicated on the incomprehensible truth that 
		the First Source and Center is the primal cause of the universal physical phenomena of all 
		space. From this divine activity all physical energy and other material manifestations are 
		derived. Light, that is, light without heat, is another of the nonspiritual manifestations 
		of the Deities. And there is still another <span class="quotation-red">form of nonspiritual

		<span>During the earlier times of universe materialization the space regions are

		early appearing hydrogen clouds of space. Under certain unusual conditions atom disruption 
		also occurs at the nucleus of the larger hydrogen masses. And all of these phenomena of atom 
		building and atom dissolution, as in the highly heated nebulae, are attended by the

		<span>Mankind should understand that we who participate in the revelation of truth are very

		the scientific discoveries of a thousand years. Revelators must act in accordance with the 
		instructions which form a part of the revelation mandate. We see no way of overcoming this 
		difficulty, either now or at any future time. We full well know that, while the historic 
		facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the 
		records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the 
		physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of
		<span class="quotation-red">additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These 
		new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly 
		undiscovered facts in the revelatory records</span>. Let it be made clear that revelations 
		are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired. It is 
		limited by our permission for the co-ordination and sorting of present-day knowledge. While 
		divine or spiritual insight is a gift, human wisdom must evolve.</span></td>
