<h3>Standardized Reference Committee Text Alterations to First Printing</h3>
	<p><strong>Function of the Standardized Reference Committee:
<br><br>
Excerpt from the Standardized Reference Text Committee Draft Report, December 2008</strong>
<br>
<br>Since the first edition of The Urantia Book was published in 1955, there have been a number of changes made over the years. At this time, Urantia Foundation is on its 19<span class="super">th</span> printing and Urantia Book Fellowship on its 4<span class="super">th</span> printing of The Urantia Book. Each version has been revised, creating the need to review the changes made, including changes in the:</p><blockquote>
1. Text;
<br>2. Formatting;
<br>3. Table of contents; and
<br>4. Referencing system</blockquote>
<p>In the winter of 2007, a joint committee was formed by Urantia Foundation and Urantia Book Fellowship to undertake this review. The committee was chaired by Seppo Kanerva. Merritt Horn, long time reader of the book, joined our detail oriented chair in finding over 300 changes for the committee to review.
<br>
<br><strong>Members of the 2007-2009 Standardized Reference Text Committee:</strong></p>
<blockquote>Chair, Seppo Kanerva, President, Urantia Foundation
<br>Liaison Chair, Marvin Gawryn, Urantia Book Fellowship
<br>Merritt Horn, Urantia Book Fellowship
<br>Nancy Johnson, Urantia Book Fellowship
<br>Marilynn Kulieke, Trustee, Urantia Foundation
<br>Jay Peregrine, Executive Director, Urantia Foundation
</blockquote><p></p>
The alterations adopted by this Committee have been incorporated in this set of Urantia files; paragraphs containing variation from the first printing text are marked with an asterisk which links to this Committee explanation document.

<h3>Changes Made to the Text in This Set of Urantia Book Files</h3>
<br>
<br><strong>General:</strong>The electronic text has Paper:Section.paragraph annotation added to each indented portion of the standardized text. Each indented portion has an invisible name address associated with it so that it can be linked to from another internet document. The link format is the file name (English file names are “p” for Paper, followed by a 3 digit paper number, 000-196, with suffix .htm — the file name for Paper 123 is p123.htm), added to that the link name address, such as #U123_4_5 for Section 4, paragraph 5 of Paper 123. The link address would be p123.htm#U123_4_5.
<br>
<br>Page and paragraph annotation, which has also been added to each indented portion of the standardized text, cannot be linked to.
<br>
<br>Titles have been converted to title case whereas in the original printing titles were in upper case.

<br>Informational: In all printings after the first, the title Foreword was moved before Part I; the text of the Foreword was moved to before the Part I title page in the book.<br>
	<br><span class="editor-left"><strong>Almanac Note:</strong> <br><br>The Almanac will modify 
	the front matter (listings of contents) only when it improves clarity and understanding.&nbsp; We will 
	not make ANY changes to the text of the Urantia Papers as

<br><a name="xiii"> </a><a href="FM_Contents.htm#xiii" target=_parent> xiii</a>
<br>Informational: In all printings after the first, the Foreword was moved before Part I; the text of the Foreword was moved to before the Part I title page in the book.<br>
<br><a name="xl_95_4"> </a><a href="FM_Contents.htm#xl_95_4" target=_parent> xl 95:4</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;4. The Teachings of <u>Amenomope</u>
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;4. The Teachings of <u>Amenemope</u>
— Amenemope is the correct spelling; his name is spelled correctly in the ten paragraphs where he is mentioned so this was simply a typographical error.<br>
<br><a name="xli_97"> </a><a href="FM_Contents.htm#xli_97" target=_parent> xli 97.</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;9. Hebrew History <u>Ephriam</u> and Judah
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Hebrew History <u>Ephraim</u> and Judah
— Ephraim is the standard transliteration of the Hebrew name.<br>
<br><a name="xlix_129_2"> </a><a href="FM_Contents.htm#xlix_129" target=_parent>xlix 129.</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;2. The Twenty-eighth Year (A.D. 22) Meeting <u>Gonid</u> and Ganid
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Twenty-eighth Year (A.D. 22) Meeting <u>Gonod</u> and Ganid
— Gonod is the correct spelling.<br>
<br><a name="lxvi"> </a><a href="FM_Contents.htm#lxvi" target=_parent>lxvi</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;<u>(An exhaustive index of the Urantia Book is published in a separate volume.)</u>
— Sentence removed.<br>
<br>

<strong>Foreword and Papers:</strong>
<br>

<br><a name="U0_1_24"> </a><a href="p000.htm#U0_1_24">0:1.24</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;5. Absolute perfection in no direction, relative perfection in all <u>other</u> manifestations.
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Absolute perfection in no direction, relative perfection in all manifestations.
— <u>other</u> removed. The original phraseology is incorrect because the reference to other manifestations requires the existence of one or more additional manifestations to which this other is being contrasted. As this particular phase of perfection exists in only one manifestation — relative perfection — there are no additional types which require or permit the use of other in this context. There error occurred when “other” was inserted into the 1955 text during one of the pre-publication transcriptions by accidentally repeating the pattern of use found immediately before and after this sentence.
<br>
<br><a name="U0_4_3"> </a><a href="p000.htm#U0_4_3">0:4.3</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;2. <em>Deified reality</em> embraces <u>all of infinite</u> Deity potentials...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <em>Deified reality</em> embraces <u>all infinite</u> Deity potentials...
— The committee decided that this revised phraseology is all-inclusive without implying any limitations and without requiring a change of tone.<br>
<br><a name="U1_0_0"> </a><a href="p001.htm">1:0.0</a>
<br>Change from first printing:&nbsp;<u>PART I The Central and Superuniverse</u>
— heading removed from the top of Paper 1. Part I is defined by the title page just prior to Paper 1. Removing the duplication is therefore a reasonable standardization.<br>
<br><a name="U11_7_7"> </a><a href="p011.htm#U11_7_7">11:7.7</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;The relatively quiet <u>zone</u> between the space levels,...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;The relatively quiet <u>zones</u> between the space levels,...
— The plural, found in all editions after 1955, agrees with the verb “are” and is otherwise consistent with the general sense of the paragraph.<br>
<br><a name="U12_4_15"> </a><a href="p012.htm#U12_4_15">12:4.15</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;But the greatest of all such distortions arises because the vast universes of outer <u>space</u>...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;But the greatest of all such distortions arises because the vast universes of outer <u>space,</u>...
— The comma after “outer space” is required to set off the parenthetical phrase concluded with the subsequent comma.<br>
<br><a name="U12_4_16"> </a><a href="p012.htm#U12_4_16">12:4.16</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;...complement or equilibrant of <u>gravity</u>
— Missing period in first printing restored.<br>
<br><a name="U24_1_11"> </a><a href="p024.htm#U24_1_11">24:1.11</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;...supervisor <u>No.</u> 572,842 has...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...supervisor <u>number</u> 572,842 has...
— The spelled-out version is more correct for this usage and is used in all similar constructions except one in the UB. Because of the orthographic dissimilarity between ‘No.’ and ‘number,’ it is necessary to explain how the former could be in the 1955 text if the latter was intended. It seems likely that the symbol ‘#’ was likely used here and perhaps at many or all of these points in the manuscript — being a common and appropriate handwritten shortcut — and was converted to ‘No.’ here at some later point at variance with the preferred usage elsewhere in the text and by a reasonable interpretation of the guidance in the CMOS.<br>
<br><a name="U28_6_4"> </a><a href="p028.htm#U28_6_4">28:6.4</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;The <u>Significance</u> of Origins are the living ready-reference genealogies...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;The <u>Significances</u> of Origins are the living ready-reference genealogies...
— The plural is required to agree with the verb “are,” and its construction is paralleled by the formation of the plural Discerner(s) of Spirits in a similar setting at <a href="p028.htm#U28_5_20">28:5.20</a> in the text. The structure of the plural as a whole is confused by the plural form of the last word in the singular of the name.<br>
<br><a name="U28_6_8"> </a><a href="p028.htm#U28_6_8">28:6.8</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;...the <u>Significance</u> of Origins teach these ascenders...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...the <u>Significances</u> of Origins teach these ascenders... Same explanation as 28:6.4 above<br>
<br><a name="U29_4_23"> </a><a href="p029.htm#U29_4_23">29:4.23</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;...the Seven Supreme Power Directors and the Seven <u>Central</u> Supervisors...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...the Seven Supreme Power Directors and the Seven <u>Center</u> Supervisors...
— There is no other reference to Seven Central Supervisors anywhere in the text but there are multiple references to Seven Center Supervisors (primary description at <a href="p029.htm#U29_2_10">29:2.10-11</a> in the text) who function closely with the Supreme Power Directors and can be very reasonably substituted here for the otherwise unknown Central Supervisors.<br>
<br><a name="U30_3_12"> </a><a href="p030.htm#U30_3_12">30:3.12</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;...beings <u>enroute</u> elsewhere who pause...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...beings <u>en route</u> elsewhere who pause...
— Although the original may be understandable, it is incorrect French and is not the form that has been adopted into English (according to Webster’s, the OED, and the Chicago Manual). A simple dropped space-key explains the original.<br>
<br><a name="U31_10_21"> </a><a href="p031.htm#U31_10_21">31:10.21</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;* * * * *
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;~ ~ ~ ~ ~
— Asterisk separators were used in the first printing at the end of Parts I and II and in several other locations. The asterisks have been replaced with tildes in this standardized HTML version to avoid confusion with the asterisks used as links from the text into this standardization document. (<a href="p031.htm#U31_10_21">31:10.21,</a>

<br><a name="U32_0_0"> </a><a href="p032.htm">32:0.0</a>
<br>Change from first printing:&nbsp;<u>PART II The Local Universe</u>
— heading removed from the top of Paper 32. Part II is defined by the title page just prior to Paper 32. Removing the duplication is therefore a reasonable standardization.<br>
<br><a name="U36_3_6"> </a><a href="p036.htm#U36_3_6">36:3.6</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;...subsequently add <u>any thing</u> new or supplemental...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...subsequently add <u>anything</u> new or supplemental...
— The compound word is the correct choice in this case. The sentence simply does not read well if, to test an alternative hypothesis, the assumption is made that the two-word format was chosen by the author for emphasis (which, to this editor, is the only discernible rationale for the two-word form).<br>
<br><a name="U37_8_3"> </a><a href="p037.htm#U37_8_3">37:8.3</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;Andovontia is the name of the <u>secondary</u> <em>Universe Circuit Supervisor</em> stationed in our local universe.
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;Andovontia is the name of the <u>tertiary</u> <em>Universe Circuit Supervisor</em> stationed stationed in our local universe.
— While both a secondary and a tertiary Circuit Supervisor are assigned to the supervision of a single local universe’s circuits, only the tertiary Circuit Supervisor is stationed within the local universe — the secondary Circuit Supervisor is located on the superuniverse headquarters (See <a href="p024.htm#U24_1_5">24:1.5-7</a> in the text). Therefore, if Andovontia is “stationed in our local universe” he would be a tertiary Universe Circuit Supervisor. A straightforward explanation for the origin of the error relies on the inferred use of the somewhat unusual but nonetheless valid abbreviations 1ry, 2ry, and 3ry in the manuscript. These abbreviations are common within several disciplines (e.g., grammar/phonetics, medicine, chemistry) and when used in close proximity to each other their meanings are clear even to the general reader, but this instance is not located near similar references, so the likelihood of its use here remains only a probability based on typographical observation, rather than a certainty. This explanation, however, makes an impossible typographical error into common one — a mis-typed character.<br>
<br><a name="U41_1_1"> </a><a href="p041.htm#U41_1_1">41:1.1</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;Within the domain of this Paradise Son of <u>God the</u> Supreme Power Centers and the Master Physical Controllers collaborated...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the domain of this Paradise Son of <u>God, the</u> Supreme Power Centers and the Master Physical Controllers collaborated...
— comma inserted. By indicating the end of the initial adverbial phrase, a comma here does greatly assist the reader. If present in the original manuscript, a simple dropped keystroke would have produced the 1955 text.<br>
<br><a name="U41_4_4"> </a><a href="p041.htm#U41_4_4">41:4.4</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;...having become <u>sixty thousand</u> times as dense as your sun...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;having become <u>forty thousand</u> times as dense as your sun...
— Textual consistency and current scientific estimates of our sun’s density both support the change to “forty thousand.” The first paragraph of this section states that our sun is about 1.5 times the density of water, or about 0.054 pounds per cubic inch, and 40,000 times this is about 2,160 pounds per cubic inch; the current scientific estimate of the sun’s density is 1.4 times the density of water; 40,000 times that is roughly 2,035 pounds per cubic inch. The likely cause of this error in the 1955 text is that the number in question was written as a numeral in the manuscript (40,000 not forty thousand), and the error was caused by a simple keystroke error in which 6 was mis-keyed for 4, creating 60,000 instead of 40,000. When the text was formatted for printing, the numerals were changed to words, and an error that formerly consisted of one digit was transformed into an incorrect word. The formatting of words and numbers for printing is not a revelatory issue; it is a matter of style, and is covered extensively in the Chicago Manual. (The problem at <a href="p043.htm#U43_1_6">43:1.6</a> in the text appears to have had an identical origin, and <a href="p042.htm#U42_5_1">42:5.1</a> in the text is very closely related.)<br>
<br><a name="U42_5_1"> </a><a href="p042.htm#U42_5_1">42:5.1</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;...ten octaves up are the X rays, followed by the <u>Y rays</u> of radium...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...ten octaves up are the X rays, followed by the <u>gamma rays</u> of radium...
— Y rays changed to gamma rays. From external reference to physics, and multiple internal cross-references (see for example <a href="p042.h5m#U42_5_7">42:5.7</a> in the text), gamma is clearly intended here. As to the origin of the “Y” in the 1955 text, it is likely that the Greek letter “?” (gamma) was mistakenly transposed into “Y” at some point in the preparation of the original edition (probably at the time of the first typing from the original manuscript) either because of a faulty inference from the immediately preceding X, from an unfamiliarity with the Greek alphabet, or simply because there was no better way to represent the character on a standard typewriter. Even though a typesetter would have been able to place the Greek letter “?” on the page, the later decision to replace that letter with gamma is clear, reasonable, and consistent with the usage found elsewhere throughout The Urantia Book.<br>
<br><a name="U42_6_7"> </a><a href="p042.htm#U42_6_7">42:6.7</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;...an electron weighs a little <u>less</u> than 1/2,000<span class="super">th</span> of the smallest atom,...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...an electron weighs a little <u>more</u> than 1/2,000<span class="super">th</span> of the smallest atom...
<br>Also:
<br>First printing:&nbsp;The positive proton... weighs <u>from two to three</u> thousand times more...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;The positive proton... weighs <u>almost two</u> thousand times more...
— [For historical reference, the first discussion of the relative masses of the structural elements of atoms in the Encyclopaedia Britannica is found in its 11<span class="super">th</span> Edition (1910 / 1911) with revisions in the 12<span class="super">th</span> (1922). The calculation of the relative masses of the electron and the hydrogen atom was undergoing a rapid evolution just prior to the writing of The Urantia Book, the ratio being 1:1700 in 1897; 1:2000 in 1904; and 1:1845 by 1922. This last ratio is also the one quoted in the 1934 Websters.] The revised wording is consistent with the statement in the paragraph following the subject paragraph <a href="p042.htm#U42_6_8">(42:6.8),</a> in the text where the author states that a proton is “eighteen hundred times as heavy as an electron;” and is also in general agreement with current scientific opinion which places the ratio at about 1:1836. After the committee’s work, this item, plus the closely-related following item, are the only recommended changes that do not have a straightforward typographical explanation.<br>
<br><a name="U42_10_1"> </a><a href="p042.htm#U42_10_1">42:10.1</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;The endless sweep of relative cosmic <u>reality</u> from the absoluteness of Paradise monota...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless sweep of relative cosmic <u>reality,</u> from the absoluteness of Paradise monota...
— comma inserted. The inserted comma, with the following one, correctly separate the enclosed parenthical phrase “from the absoluteness...of space potency,...” from the primary structure of the sentence.<br>
<br><a name="U43_1_6"> </a><a href="p043.htm#U43_1_6">43:1.6</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;...established almost <u>four</u> thousand years ago, immediately after...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...established almost <u>forty</u> thousand years ago, immediately after...
— The second edition correction appears to be warranted based on a reference at <a href="p119.htm#U119_7_2">119:7.2</a> in the text: “The public announcement that Michael had selected Urantia as the theater for his final bestowal was made shortly after we learned about the default of Adam and Eve. And thus, for more than thirty-five thousand years, your world occupied a very conspicuous place in the councils of the entire universe.” The default occurred about 37,800 years ago, so “almost forty thousand” and “more than thirty-five thousand” would seem to be equally reasonable descriptions. The committee concluded that the problem here is identical in origin to that of 
<a href="p041.htm#U41_4_4">41:4.4</a> in the text: the number in question was written as a numeral in the manuscript (40,000 not forty thousand), and the error was caused by the loss of a zero before the number was formatted into words for printing.<br>
<br><a name="U43_8_2"> </a><a href="p043.htm#U43_8_2">43:8.2</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;While you are <u>rekeyed</u> each time...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;While you are <u>re-keyed</u> each time...
— The only other occurrence of re-keyed is in hyphenated form <a href="p048.htm#U48_2_21">(48:2.21)</a> in the text. Words formed with the “re-” prefix, fall under the same general Chicago Manual rule, but this instance is covered by an exception: “a) When the first vowel of the added word would...suggest mispronunciation, the hyphen is retained.” In this case, the un-hyphenated form appears to indicate that the first syllable is pronounced with a short e, causing the reader to stumble. Insertion of the hyphen resolves the problem.<br>
<br><a name="U44_0_1"> </a><a href="p044.htm#U44_0_1">44:0.1</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;Among the courtesy colonies of the various divisional and universe headquarters <u>worlds,</u> may be found the unique order of composite personalities... 
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the courtesy colonies of the various divisional and universe headquarters <u>worlds</u> may be found the unique order of composite personalities... 
— This is the only one of the committee's recommendations that allows the reasonableness of the original but recommends the change because both publishers have long since adopted the change.<br>
<br><a name="U45_5_6"> </a><a href="p045.htm#U45_5_6">45:5.6</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;<u>Some time</u> they hope to be granted virtually complete autonomy.
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Sometime</u> they hope to be granted virtually complete autonomy.
— The one-word form is correct as the reference is to an indefinite point in time rather than to an indefinite period of time. (See Webster’s) Given the location of this word in the 1955 text — with a line break occurring between Some and time — it is possible that the original error was simply a missing end-of-line hyphen.<br>
<br><a name="U56_7_8"> </a><a href="p056.htm#U56_7_8">56:7.8</a>
<br>First printing:&nbsp;We might conjecture that such a plan must prevail in the outer universes; on the other <u>hand</u> the new orders...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;We might conjecture that such a plan must prevail in the outer universes; on the other <u>hand,</u> the new orders...
— The structure of the sentence calls for a comma here. In the 1955 text, <u>hand</u> was at the end of the line - so the comma could easily have been dropped.<br>
<br><a name="U57_0_0"> </a><a href="p057.htm">57:0.0</a> Change from first printing:&nbsp;<u>PART III The History of Urantia</u>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Amebas</u> are typical survivors of this initial stage of animal life,...
— The plural is required here to agree with the predicate “...are typical surviors...” A modernized Latin plural form “amebae” could be used without being a unique choice (see for example “Seleucidae” at <a href="p059.htm#U59_2_12">59:2.12</a> in the text) but as the authors chose to use the modern form “ameba” rather than “amoeba” the committee decided that the English form “amebas” would be appropriate.<br>

— A single mistaken keystroke could have produced martins from an intended martens. It is also possible, however, that the original form was the author’s choice, being a correct, though less common, variant. (We cannot assert that the author would not use an unusual variant, because coons was used for raccoons only two pages previously. <a href="p061.htm#U61_2_7">(61:2.7</a> in the text.) However, even if originally correct, this usage of “martin” is no longer current so the modernization of the spelling is reasonable.<br>

— This sentence clearly introduces the following list, so the colon is appropriate. In the 1955 text, this is found at end-of-line, immediately below another line ending with a period, so a typesetting error by inadvertent pattern copying could have easily given rise to the original.

— Neither ‘people’ nor ‘peoples’ appear here in the original Greek of this Matthew passage; a more common rendering being “And they brought to him all the sick...” However, if one form or another of ‘people’ is to be used to place the Matthew passage in this context, ‘peoples,’ which indicates not multiple individuals but multiple large groups of people — whether tribal, national, or other, does not fit the grammar of the sentence and is clearly not intended here. A mistaken additional keystroke would account for the problem; ‘peoples’ should be changed to ‘people.’<br>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;was there a civilization in <u>any way</u> comparable.
— The two-word form is the appropriate choice when serving as an adverb only, rather than as an adverbial conjunction, in which case the compound “anyway” is more common. This latter use, roughly synonymous with “at any rate” or “in any case,” is well illustrated by its only occurrence in the papers <a href="p148.htm#U148_6_4">(at 148:6.4)</a> when Job’s friend, Eliphaz, is quoted as saying: “Anyway, man seems predestined to trouble, and perhaps the Lord is only chastising you for your own good.”<br>

— The change from “west” to “east,” as found in many printings, is geographically correct but typographically impossible; the committee adopted the alternate “West” referring to the Western Hemisphere — the word thus indicating a place rather than a direction of travel.<br>

— A change for the purpose of database standardization is reasonable, as the original text contained both forms at different locations, so the committee decided upon the more modern form. The origin of the variants in the text may be related to a change in recommended spellings between the 1927 and 1937 editions of the Chicago Manual. (The former specifying Graeco-, the latter, Greco-.) The OED and Webster’s include both forms, but their preferences are split along lines the reader can, no doubt, predict.

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...a <u>lifelong</u> partnership of self-effacement, compromise...
— The committee decided for database standardization here and at <a href="#U80_8_1">(89:8.1)</a> below, as out of the ten occurrences of lifelong or life-long in the text, only these two were hyphenated. Although Webster’s lists the compound word, differences between Chicago Manual editions may have given rise to the varied spellings. The 1927 and 1937 editions contain the general rule: “Compounds of ‘life’ and ‘world’ require a hyphen: life-history, life-principle (but: lifetime)...” But the 1949 Chicago Manual modifies the rule slightly and lists “lifelong” as a specific example: “Compounds with ‘god’ and some compounds of ‘life’ require a hyphen: ...life-history, life-line, life-principle, life-story (but: lifeblood, lifelong, lifetime, etc.)”<br>

<br>Informational: first printing; Baptism became a religious ceremonial in Babylon, and the Creeks practiced the annual ritual bath. The Urantia Book passage does appear to parallel the first paragraph of Chapter IV in Hopkins, <em>Origin and Evolution of Religion,</em> (Yale 1923), and the typographical difference between “Greeks” and “Creeks” is only one letter — an easy error — however, the flow of references is slightly different, making “Creeks” seem out of context in The Urantia Book. Further, and more importantly, it is inappropriate to modify the text of The Urantia Book based on an assumed link to another text. If the revalators had stated that they were quoting Hopkins, or if there were no Greeks who practiced the annual ritual bath (which is not true — such a rite was practiced by the adherents of the Eleusinian mysteries, one of the largest cults of the Greek world in the times prior to Jesus’ bestowal), then it could be reasonably asserted that a typographical mistake had been made. In the absence of such an error or such a direct assertion by the author of the paper, renders such a change beyond the scope of the editor’s range of action. The authors of The Urantia Book often adapted pre-existing texts to their own purposes — modifying them as they deemed appropriate.<br>

— The two-word form is appropriate when referring to some one member of a particular group, as “Some one of you will go with me...” The compound form is used when the group of which the ‘one’ is a member is not specified. Fowler (1926) clarifies the differentiation by stating that ‘someone’ should be used when ‘somebody’ could be substituted for it; ‘some one’ should be used in all other cases.<br>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole phallic cult grew up as a defense against <u>the evil eye.</u>
— The phrase “evil eye” without an article seems extremely stilted, while such forms may have been used somewhere by some author, the committee could find no instances of such usage — even in texts of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries — and certainly could not find a reason not to amend the text here to conform with normal practice.<br>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon it became the custom to <u>forgo</u> many forms of physical pleasure, especially of a sexual nature.
— The revised “forgo” is etymologically preferable and so has been adopted by the committee. However, it should be noted that “forego” was not an error per se, it has been in use for over 400 years and leads to no confusion. [F]orego/foregoing is also found at three other locations in the text, while forgo was absent altogether. Though forego appears (for the first time for either form) as the preference in the 11<span class="super">th</span> edition (1949) of the Chicago Manual, the modern trend has been toward the adopted revised form.<br>

— Early Egyptians developed a system of exchange of gold and silver rings, but true coinage was not introduced until the period of Persian domination (525-415 BCE), during which the gold daric and silver siglos of Darius I (reigned from 521-485 BCE) would have been used for some transactions. Coins were not actually minted in Egypt until ~ 404-343 BCE during the brief period of independence between the 1st Persian period and the reconquest by Artaxerxes III (342-336 BCE), when silver imitation Athenian Owls were minted. Coins were regularly minted in Egypt during the Ptolemaic (283-30 BCE) and subsequent Roman periods. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_Harris_I">Harris Papyrus I</a> commemorates the reign of Rameses III, and was commissioned by his son Rameses IV at the former’s death in 1172 BCE. The list of gifts to the Gods in the UB at 89:4.9, excerpted from this papyrus, thus predates the earliest significant presence of coins in Egypt by 650-750 years. Therefore, the reference in The Urantia Book is a simple typo made when quoting a known source; but regardless of quantities, the 1955 text cannot be correct — it is erroneous on its face. This is the key difference between this item and the <a href="#U85_4_1">Greek/Creek item above.</a>
This precise list, including the “coin” typo, is found in William Graham Sumner/Albert G. Keller, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Graham_Sumner" target=_parent><em>The Science of Socety,</em></a> Yale, 1927.

— Tenskwatawa is the standard transliteration for the Shawnee prophet’s name; the spelling in the first edition may have been caused by a mistaken keystroke or may have been the result of an error in reading the original manuscript. (Regarding the latter possibility, see the note for <a href="#U195_3_10">195:3.10.)</a> — 1808 — Since nothing in the text is dependent on the 1808 date, nor linked to it in any way, and since the change from the incorrect to the correct date — 1806 — is just one digit/keystroke, this is no more significant a change from a technical standpoint than the correction of a spelling mistake — except that so many people have spent so much time making so much over this obvious mistake in The Urantia Book.<br>

— “Level values” has no discernible meaning in this context; “of” must have been omitted at some point in the process of preparing the text for publication. The phrase “Level of values” is not only meaningful, but consistent with the context, and is also a parallel construction to the other items in this series: “Depth of meanings”; “Consecration intensity” (i.e., ‘Intensity of consecration’); and “progress of the personality.”<br>

— This was the only instance of the un-hyphenated form “far distant” in the 1955 text. The committee’s decision to hyphenate and thereby standardize usage in The Urantia Book is the least complex resolution to the perceived problem of variant forms of the term and is in agreement with Webster’s of 1934.<br>

— The original phraseology asserts that Lao-Tse himself was speaking in the past tense as in “man’s destiny used to be everlasting union...” This would be a very strange construction and could not have been the intention either of Lao-Tse nor of the paper’s author. The relocation of the opening quotation mark resolves the difficulty and relies on a straightforward typing or typesetting error.<br>

— The difference between “none the less” and “nonetheless” as followed throughout the 1955 text — except at this point — is thus: “None the less” is used where the meaning is a comparative roughly equivalent to “no less,” and the latter could be substituted without a change in meaning. “Nonetheless” is interchangeable with “nevertheless” and is used when the meaning approximates “even so."<br>

— While it may be possible to extract some meaning from the original wording, changing “eternal” to “external” on the basis of an assumed dropped keystroke in the original, suddenly makes the sentence not only clear in meaning but also reveals a contrastive point which is completely absent from the original. (This also resolves the otherwise completely opaque “Ethics is the eternal...racial mirror...”)<br>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;Unifier of the deified and the undeified; <u>correlator</u> of the absolute... 
— Although it is possible that the original word (which is not found in either Webster’s or the OED) was a coined extension of corelation and corelative (both of which are found), it is not readily apparent how corelater would differ in meaning from correlator(s), the now standard form, which is found five times elsewhere in the text. The more likely situation is that two separate typographical errors were made when this word was set. The first was a dropped keystroke error at the end of a line of type; the second was an incorrect keystroke error, substituting e for o. This doubly misspelled word would still be difficult to catch in proofing because it would sound the same if read out loud, and interestingly enough, if it looked odd to a proofreader and consequently led him or her to consult the dictionary, the spelling could neither be confirmed nor denied by either Webster’s or the OED — neither dictionary contained correlator or corelater — and without an electronically searchable text, it is unlikely that the evidence of the otherwise unanimous usage within the revelation itself could have been brought to bear on the problem.<br>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...the union of God the Supreme, God the Ultimate, and the <u>unrevealed</u> Consummator of Universe Destiny.
— The lowercase version appears to be correct because “unrevealed” does not seem to be part of the name but is solely descriptive (the title being found in several places without unrevealed preceding it). In the one other case in which “unrevealed” is found in conjunction with Consummator of Universe Destiny, it is not capitalized <a href="p000.htm#U0_12_7">(0:12.7)</a> in the text. [“Unrevealed” is found in one other location as a capitalized component of a title — The “Unrevealed Creative Agencies of the Ancients of Days”

— The original text does appear unusual at first glance because one expects a noun like ‘possibility’ to be modified by an adjective such as ‘eternal’; not by another noun. In this situation however, ‘eternity’ is not serving as an adjective, rather the two nouns together form a single concept or nominal group, identical in structure to the group which ends the subject sentence: “...man is the Adjuster’s personality possibility.”<br>

— Free-willness is found at four other locations in the text and all in instances it refers to an attribute or characteristic of a being or beings. Freewill and free will each occur numerous times — the former as an adjective (modifying such words as choice, action, or personality), while the two-word form is used when free modifies will itself (i.e. when will is under discussion). In light of these consistent usages, conforming this variant is appropriate as the original was probably the result of a dropped hyphen.<br>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;But to accept the fallacy of omnificence is to embrace the colossal error of <u>pantheism.</u>
— Though religions and even philosophical schools are normally capitalized, e.g. “Platonism,” “Stoicism,” “Deism,” “pantheism” is more of a philosophical concept than an organized system of ideas and so is normally not capitalized — either currently or in writings contemporaneous with The Urantia Book.<br>

<br>Informational: first printing; These men of God visited the newborn child in the manger.
— “in the manger” removed at the second printing. Presumably, this change was made because the original seems to be inconsistent with the narrative of Jesus’ birth in 122:8, which states that three wise men from the east visited Jesus when he was almost three weeks old — about the time the family left the inn and over two weeks after they had moved out of the stable. However, it is certainly possible that Joseph and Mary might have taken the manger with them up to the room in the inn in order to continue to have a cradle for Jesus. The need for a cradle would have been no less in the room than in the stable, and if the manger was portable, as small feed-boxes often are, moving it along with the family seems quite reasonable.<br>

<br>Informational: first printing; Far to the east they could discern the Jordan valley and, far beyond, the rocky hills of Moab. Also to the south and the east...
— Punctuation and wording changes were rejected by the committtee. The context for this sentence is the “panoramic view” from atop the Nazareth hill: Jesus and his father are standing on top of the hill and are moving their gaze from Mt. Carmel in the northwest around an arc to the north, east, south and west. Mt. Hermon is to their north, and from springs in its foothills near Dan (northeast of Nazareth) the Jordan valley extends to the Dead Sea in the south. Thus, as Jesus and Joseph follow the line of the river valley along the arc of their survey, as the Jordan approaches the Dead Sea, father and son “discern...far beyond, the rocky hills of Moab.” This interpretation is further supported by the punctuation of the following sentence which does not read “Also, to the south and the east,...” (suggesting a change in direction from the last reference), but rather, “Also to the south and the east,...” which implies that the last referenced location (Moab) was in the same direction.<br>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...its abject fear-slave and the <u>bond servant</u> of depression... 
— Bond servant is found in three different forms in the first edition. The only form found in our primary references is the open form (bond servant) in Webster’s. The decision was made to standardize on the open form. This word is hyphenated and is broken at the hyphen to begin a new line of type, so it is impossible to determine whether ‘bond-servant’ or ‘bondservant’ was intended. The only form that the type (as set) could not have represented was the two-word form ‘bond servant’. In the following sentence, ‘bondservant’ is found as one word, so it would be a reasonable assumption that the same closed form was intended here. Both ‘bond servant’ and ‘bond-servant’ are found once elsewhere in the Urantia papers 
<a href=p060.htm#U69_5_8>(69:5.8</a> and <a href=p130.htm#U130_6_3>130:6.3,</a> respectively). In the 10<span class="super">th</span> and 11<span class="super">th</span> Urantia Foundation printings, both occurrences in the present paragraph were separated into two words, as was the <a href=p130.htm#U130_6_3>130:6.3</a> instance, thus standardizing all four to the two-word format. Database standardization could be reasonable for this word, but the electronic editions and the printed texts subsequent to the 11<span class="super">th</span> have diverged (as noted).<br>

<br>First printing:&nbsp;...functioning of a consciousness sorter and <u>associater</u>...
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;...functioning of a consciousness sorter and <u>associator</u>...
— While the meaning of ‘associater’ is clear and that variant is found in a reference dating to 1616 in the OED, it is probably the result of a keystroke error because the common form, ‘associator’, is the unanimous usage elsewhere in the text. [Unlike other archaic English words occasionally used in The Urantia Book to convey unique meanings (e.g., inconcussible at <a href="p118.htm#U118_3_3">118:3.3</a> in the text) the ancient word-form ‘associater’ did not convey a meaning distinct from ‘associator’ and no such differentiation is apparent here.] The original spelling may have been caused by a typist’s inadvertent repetition of the ‘er’ pattern from sorter, but in any case, the committee chose to adopt the modern and consistently used form.<br>

Main Reference on Caesarea-Philippi: Of the 24 occurrences of the name of this town (plus four additional instances found in page headers), only two are found in the un-hyphenated form in the 1955 text, and both of those are on the same page, here and <a href="p134.htm#U134_8_1">134:8.1</a> in the text on page 1492).
— Caesarea-Philippi is the standard. The twenty-two (plus 4) instances of the hyphenated form are found in six different papers, one of which is named “At Caesarea-Philippi.” The statistical unlikelihood of having, in a carefully edited text, two intended forms of a word and twenty-two incorrect forms, is ridiculously high. The text itself bears strong witness to standardizing on the hyphenated form rather than the open one. Though the open form is in more common use, the hyphenated form has been found in texts pre-dating the UB and is found today in various references (as illustrated in the Image document). So, the format used in the UB is neither unique nor incorrect. Given the almost universal consistency of usage in the text, the hyphenated form must have been the author’s choice and has been adopted by the committee.<br>

Exceptions are the possessive of ancient proper names in -es and -is and the possessive Jesus’...” [author’s emphasis] Usage in the 1955 text follows, with only this exception, the more modern practices supported by Fowler and Strunk.

— Quotation marks — single or double — should always enclose a comma or period which follows the last word of the the section set off by the quotation marks. The 9<span class="super">th</span> CMOS (1927) states it rather strongly: “Put the period inside the quotation marks.

— In the original format, Lord was the last word in the line, making a dropped comma not unlikely. It is possible that the comma was simply viewed as unnecessary within such a short phrase, and it should also be noted that while the use of the comma in direct address is now regarded as standard, the Chicago Manual was silent on the matter until its 12<span class="super">th</span> edition (1969).

— Arguments can be made for several different ways of punctuating this sentence. The original, though reasonable by the rules, is very difficult to read — almost always causing the reader to stumble.

<br>Informational: first printing ...Bethphage...; — The 1955 text uses Bethpage in all thirteen occurrences of this word. In the 4<span class="super">th</span> printing, the original was changed to Bethphage here, and at ten other locations; the remaining two were changed in the 9<span class="super">th</span> printing. These changes were presumably made because Bethphage is the spelling found in English Bibles since the Authorized Version (King James) of 1611. While the apparent misspelling in The Urantia Book is not theologically or historically significant, it seems unlikely to the committee that so many identical typographical errors could have occurred, so the spelling “Bethpage” must have been used in the original manuscript. The committee made its decision to retain the original form based on three factors: 1) It is the only form found in the text of the UB itself; 2)The form is a reasonably accurate transliteration of the sound of the original; and 3) Though the form found in the UB is uncommon, it is not unique — the spelling having been found in numerous texts pre-dating the UB and in various references down to the present day including a number on the Web.<br>

<br>First printing:&nbsp;Lazarus remained at the Bethany home, being the center of great interest to many sincere believers and to numerous curious individuals, until the <u>day</u> of the crucifixion of Jesus, when he received warning that the Sanhedrin had decreed his death.
<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazarus remained at the Bethany home, being the center of great interest to many sincere believers and to numerous curious individuals, until the <u>days</u> of the crucifixion of Jesus, when he received warning that the Sanhedrin had decreed his death.
— The change from “day” to “days” here is required because the former is inconsistent with the ensuing narrative (at <a href="p174.htm">174:0.1,</a> <a href="p175.htm#U175_3_1">175:3.1,</a> and <a href="p177.htm#U177_5_3">177:5.3)</a> which would place the time of Lazarus’s flight between Tuesday at midnight (when his death was decreed by the Sanhedrin) and Wednesday evening (when “certain ones” at the camp “knew that Lazarus had taken hasty flight from Bethany”) — two days before the crucifixion of Jesus. Because of the near impossibility of a typographical error leading from “week” in the manuscript to the “day” found in the 1955 text, the committee rejected the “week” resolution (found in numerous printings) and adopted “days.” If the original manuscript read “days,” the loss of only a single character in typesetting would create the problematic “day.” This is a very common type of error and well within the realm of possibility. Though “days” is a new resolution to this problem and therefore unfamiliar to readers — perhaps some will see it as a “stretch” — it bears repeating (as with West/west at <a href="#U79_5_6">(79:5.6)</a> above that if the 1955 text had originally read “days,” there would have been no contradiction in the text and the issue would never have been raised in the first place.<br>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who <u>was laid</u> at this rich man’s gate,...
— This sentence, as structured, does require “lay” rather than “laid,” the former being the past tense of the intransitive verb “to lie;” the latter being the past of the transitive verb “to lay.” However, it is the committee’s opinion that the error here is not poor grammar by the author, but a lost word in transcription. The authors of Part IV of The Urantia Book generally follow the text of the American Standard Version (ASV) of 1901, with certain modernizations and corrections as needed. The ASV text of Luke 16:19-21 is as follows: “Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day: and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores, and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores.” In view of the apparent reliance of The Urantia Book on the ASV at this point, the committee decided to reject “lay” and reconstruct the verb as “was laid.” Additional contextual support for this argument is based on the beggar’s inability to fend for himself. If “even the dogs came and licked his sores,” he surely would have been carried to the rich man’s gate by others, who would then have laid him there.<br>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew was busy watching some of his associates <u>who</u> he feared might be led away by their emotions...
— The pronoun here is the subject of the verb phrase “might be led away;” not the object of “feared.” To clarify, Andrew feared they might be led away by their emotions; he was not watching his associates, whom he feared. — He did not fear them, but he was afraid they might be led astray.

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;He was concerned about the attitude of some of the twelve <u>who</u> he knew were armed with swords...
— The pronoun is the subject of the verb “were armed,” not the object of “knew” nor of “were armed;” therefore “who” is the correct form. To illustrate: ...some of the twelve whom he knew Peter had armed...[he knew Peter had armed them] ...some of the twelve who he knew were armed... [he knew they were armed] The sentence might have been written “He was concerned about the attitude of the twelve, some of whom he knew were armed with swords.” In which case, “whom” would be the object of the prepositional phrase “some of whom,” while the phrase itself would be the subject of “were armed,” but it was not.<br>

— This is a situation similar to the two found at <a href="#U172_5_2">172:5.2</a> above. The pronoun concerned is the subject of love, not the object of think; therefore who is the correct form.

<br>First printing:&nbsp;...he said to the <u>twelve:</u> “And as often as you do this...

— There were only eleven apostles still present for the establishment of the remembrance supper because Judas had left earlier; so the “twelve” of the 1955 text was incorrect, and was changed to “apostles” to make this sentence consistent with the rest of the narrative. However, if the manuscript had read “apostles” it could not have become “twelve” in the course of text preparation, therefore a different solution was required. The committee adopted “eleven” as the resolution of this problem based on the proposition that the manuscript contained numerals at this point — as written documents commonly do — thus “11.” At some point prior to formatting for printing, the last digit was changed either by accident or through the common typographical error of seeing what you expect to see rather than what is on the page. When the number was formatted for printing, the “12” which was so similar to “11” became “twelve” which is completely dissimilar to “eleven.” [Note that there are several other examples of errors in the 1955 text that apparently had a similar origin: see <a href="#U37_3_3">37:8.3,</a> <a href="#U41_4_4">41:4.4</a> and <a href="#U43_1_6">43:1.6</a> above; the several time statements that are formatted incorrectly — <a href="#U134_3_3">134:3.3.1-3</a> and <a href="#U177_4_1">177:4.1</a> above also lend weight to the idea that numbers were written as numerals in the manuscript (as is common practice), and were formatted to words later in the process of text preparation.]

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Pantaenus</u> taught Clement and then went on to follow Nathaniel...
— The correct spelling of this name is Pantaenus; Dr. Sadler, in a <a href="http://www.ubhistory.org/Documents/BK19590317_SadlerW_06.pdf">March 17, 1959 letter to the Reverend Benjamin Adams</a> of San Francisco, suggested the possible source of the error: “I think the spelling of the name of the teacher in Alexandria is undoubtedly an error in transcribing the manuscript into typewriting. An “an” was undoubtedly transcribed as an “ou”. I remember when we were sometimes in doubt as to whether a letter was an “n” or a “u” in the manuscript. Of course, we who were preparing this matter, did not know the name of this teacher so could have easily made this mistake.”<br>

<br>Changed to:&nbsp;&nbsp;And the spirit of the Father is in his <u>Sons’</u> sons — mortal men.
— Sons’ does appear to be correct in light of the prior sentence which provides the context — “...this life of the Father is in his Sons.”
