# Archived Code Directory

This directory contains archived code that is no longer actively used but is kept for reference.

## Contents

### apps/reader

The original `apps/reader` directory was archived here during the repository cleanup process. It has been replaced by `apps/ub-reader` to match the package name "ub-reader" in package.json.

The contents of this directory were copied to `apps/ub-reader`, and all references to the UB Reader application should now use `apps/ub-reader`.

This archived copy is kept for reference and can be deleted after verifying that the new `apps/ub-reader` directory is working correctly.
