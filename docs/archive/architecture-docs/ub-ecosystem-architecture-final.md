# UB Ecosystem Architecture: Foundational Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the architecture and design philosophy of the UB Ecosystem - a collection of applications, packages, and services centered around the UB Reader. The ecosystem is structured as a monorepo, allowing for separate deployment of applications while sharing core components, features, and design patterns.

## Core Principles

### 1. Centralized Reader, Distributed Publications

The UB Reader serves as the central application in our ecosystem. It is designed to be:

- **Standalone**: Fully functional as an independent application
- **Extensible**: Capable of being branded and customized for different publications
- **Foundational**: Changes to the core reader propagate to all publication-specific readers

### 2. Shared Components with Publication-Specific Customization

The ecosystem follows a "develop once, deploy many" philosophy:

- **Core Components**: Developed in shared packages
- **Publication Customization**: Applied through configuration and theming
- **Feature Parity**: All publications benefit from core feature development

### 3. Exemplary Reading Experience

The reading experience is the most crucial shared function across all publications:

- **Typography Excellence**: Optimal readability across devices
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Consistent navigation patterns adapted to content structure
- **Annotation System**: Highlighting, notes, and references available across all publications
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design principles

### 4. Modular Architecture

The ecosystem is built on a modular architecture that enables:

- **Independent Development**: Teams can work on different packages simultaneously
- **Selective Feature Adoption**: Publications can adopt features selectively
- **Incremental Upgrades**: Components can be upgraded independently
