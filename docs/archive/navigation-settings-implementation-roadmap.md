- [ ] Identify any accessibility issues
- [ ] Make adjustments based on feedback

### Milestone 5.3: Launch Preparation

- [ ] Finalize documentation
- [ ] Create demo showcasing new features
- [ ] Prepare release notes
- [ ] Conduct final code review
- [ ] Merge changes into main branch

## Implementation Considerations

### Cross-cutting Concerns

- **State Management**: Consider using React Context or a state management library to handle shared state between components
- **Theming**: Implement CSS variables for easy theme switching
- **Internationalization**: Prepare for future localization by using a translation framework
- **Testing Strategy**: Use a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end tests

### Technical Debt Management

- Refactor any duplicated code into shared utilities
- Create abstractions for common patterns
- Document any temporary solutions that need future improvement
- Maintain a list of known issues and future enhancements

### Risk Mitigation

- **Browser Compatibility**: Test across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Profile and optimize any slow operations
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Conduct regular accessibility audits
- **Mobile Experience**: Test thoroughly on various mobile devices

## Resource Allocation

### Development Team

- 1 Senior Frontend Developer (Lead)
- 1 UI/UX Designer
- 1 Frontend Developer
- 1 QA Engineer

### Tools and Technologies

- React for component development
- TypeScript for type safety
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- Storybook for component documentation
- Lighthouse for performance and accessibility auditing

This roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing the navigation and settings features, with clear milestones and tasks to track progress. The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, reducing the risk of integration issues.
