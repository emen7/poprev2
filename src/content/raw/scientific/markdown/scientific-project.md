## Document Structure Recommendations

- Implement a hierarchical data model for the main paper and its seven satellites
- Design a consistent reference system for cross-paper citations
- Create unique identifiers for each section and paragraph to enable precise linking

**Search and Navigation Features:**

- Develop a comprehensive search index covering all papers and their relationships
- Implement a table of contents with collapsible sections for easy navigation
- Add breadcrumb navigation to help users understand their location within documents

**Reading Experience:**

- Design a clean, distraction-free reading interface with adjustable text size and contrast
- Create a split-view option to compare related sections across documents
- Include a "citation view" that shows the context of referenced passages

**Reference Checking:**

- Build a verification system that validates all cross-document references
- Implement hover previews that show snippets of referenced content without leaving the current page
- Add visual indicators for citation types (direct quotes, conceptual references, etc.)
