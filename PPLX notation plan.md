# Notations Plan for UB Reader Implementation

The following suggestions are offered for implementing highlights and notes functionality in the UB Reader, inspired by Kindle-like features while maintaining the specific needs of the Urantia Papers.

## Highlighting Implementation

**Text Selection Approach**

- Consider implementing text selection via press-and-hold gestures on mobile and standard click-and-drag on desktop[^2]
- Upon text selection, display a compact floating menu with highlighting and note options[^2][^6]
- For Perplexity-style highlighting, change the text color itself rather than applying a background highlight effect

**Color System**

- Implement a four-color system (yellow, green, orange, purple) similar to standard e-readers while ensuring good contrast in both light and dark themes[^2][^6]
- Store color preference with each highlight for consistent display across sessions
- Consider adding a subtle underline to highlighted text for additional visibility without overwhelming the reading experience

**Visual Indicators**

- Add subtle margin indicators where highlights or notes exist for easy navigation while scrolling
- Ensure highlighted text maintains excellent readability by testing color combinations against all theme backgrounds[^3]


## Notes Functionality

**Creation Interface**

- After selecting text, allow users to add notes via a notepad icon in the selection menu[^2]
- Present a clean, unobtrusive note editor that opens in a side panel rather than a modal overlay[^7]
- Include basic formatting options (bold, italic, lists) to allow for structured note-taking[^5]

**Storage Structure**

- Consider a data model that connects notes directly to highlights:

```
{
  id: "unique-id",
  paperNumber: 120,
  sectionId: "120:3.12",
  selectedText: "highlighted content",
  color: "yellow",
  note: "User's note text",
  createdAt: timestamp,
  tags: ["concept", "important"]
}
```

**Note Indicators**

- Display a subtle icon near highlighted text that contains attached notes
- Consider different visual treatments for highlights with and without notes


## Organization and Management

**Centralized Notes View**

- Create a dedicated "Notes \& Highlights" section accessible from the main navigation[^2]
- Organize notes primarily by Paper number as the default sort order
- Support alternative sorting by date created, color, or tags[^4]

**Categorization System**

- Implement a flexible tagging system for organizing highlights and notes[^1][^4]
- Allow custom color coding to visually differentiate between different types of annotations[^4]
- Consider implementing "collections" functionality to group related highlights together

**Search Capabilities**

- Enable full-text search across all notes and highlighted content
- Support filtering by paper, section, date, color, and tags
- Display search results with adequate context showing sentences before and after matches


## User Experience Considerations

**Interface Design**

- Keep the notes interface clean and distraction-free while maintaining visual harmony with the reader[^5]
- Use size, color, and placement to indicate importance and maintain visual hierarchy[^3]
- Consider a sliding panel approach for the notes interface to maximize screen real estate[^7]

**Navigation**

- Provide seamless navigation between the centralized notes view and the original context in the Papers
- Implement a "back to notes" button when viewing a note's context in the main reader
- Allow multi-note comparison for advanced study sessions[^4]

**Export and Sharing**

- Support exporting notes in various formats (plain text, markdown, PDF)
- Consider implementing citation generation for academic use[^2]
- Add sharing functionality with proper Paper citations automatically included

This plan aims to create a robust, user-friendly annotation system that supports both casual reading and in-depth study of the Urantia Papers while maintaining optimal performance and reliability.
