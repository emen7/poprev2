Please implement a reader background color scheme as follows:

For dark mode: Use true black (#000000) for the outer frame and a dark gray (#181A1B or #23272F) for the reading background. Text should be a soft off-white (#E8E6E3).

For light mode: Use pure white (#FFFFFF) or off-white (#F5F6F7) for the frame, and a very light gray or cream (#FAFAFA or #F7F6F3) for the reading background. Text should be a dark gray (#222222).

Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility (WCAG AA/AAA), and avoid pure white-on-black or black-on-white for body text to reduce eye fatigue.

The color palette should feel modern, minimal, and unobtrusive, supporting long-form reading.
