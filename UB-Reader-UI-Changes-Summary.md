# UB Reader UI Changes Implementation Summary

This document summarizes all the changes implemented based on the requirements specified in the UI Improvements Plan.

## 1. Section Title Styling

- Removed `text-transform: uppercase` from section titles in both traditional and modern formatting styles

**Files modified:**

- `packages/ui/src/content/SectionRenderer.css`

## 2. Pullup Bar Improvements

- Reduced default minHeight from 100px to 40px for a less intrusive appearance
- Modified transform logic to keep the handle visible when collapsed
- Added state management to reset height when toggling tabs

- No "Drag to Resize" label present in the implementation

**Files modified:**

- `packages/ui/src/pullup/PullupPanel.tsx`
- `packages/ui/src/pullup/Pullup.tsx`

## 3. Tab Layout Adjustments

- Made tab labels adjacent with minimal spacing:
  - Reduced padding from 12px/16px to 12px/10px
  - Eliminated margin-right between tabs
  - Reduced gap between icon and text
- Added explicit left-alignment to tabs with `justify-content: flex-start`

**Files modified:**

## 4. Text Alignment Settings

## 5. Paragraph Numbering Format

## 6. Notes Feature Coordination

- Created a separate column for notes indicators to the left of paragraph numbers

## Visual Changes Overview

### Before:
