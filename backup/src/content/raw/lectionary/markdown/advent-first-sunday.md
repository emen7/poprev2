# First Sunday of Advent

## Scripture Readings

### Isaiah 64:1-9

> Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down,
> that the mountains would tremble before you!
> As when fire sets twigs ablaze
> and causes water to boil,
> come down to make your name known to your enemies
> and cause the nations to quake before you!
> For when you did awesome things that we did not expect,
> you came down, and the mountains trembled before you.
> Since ancient times no one has heard,
> no ear has perceived,
> no eye has seen any God besides you,
> who acts on behalf of those who wait for him.

### Psalm 80:1-7, 17-19

> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,
> you who lead Joseph like a flock.
> You who sit enthroned between the cherubim,
> shine forth before Ephraim, Benjamin and Manasseh.
> Awaken your might;
> come and save us.
> Restore us, O God;
> make your face shine on us,
> that we may be saved.

### 1 Corinthians 1:3-9

> Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
>
> I always thank my God for you because of his grace given you in Christ Jesus. For in him you have been enriched in every way—with all kinds of speech and with all knowledge—God thus confirming our testimony about Christ among you. Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to be revealed. He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

### Mark 13:24-37

> "But in those days, following that distress, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.
>
> "At that time people will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.
>
> "Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door. Truly I tell you, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.

## Reflection

The First Sunday of Advent marks the beginning of the liturgical year. It is a time of expectation, hope, and preparation for the coming of Christ. The readings for this Sunday focus on the theme of watchfulness and readiness for the Lord's coming.

In the reading from Isaiah, we hear the prophet's longing for God to "rend the heavens and come down." This powerful imagery expresses the deep human desire for divine intervention in times of trouble. The prophet recalls God's past actions and appeals to God's mercy and faithfulness.

The Psalm continues this theme of longing for God's presence and intervention. The repeated refrain, "Restore us, O God; make your face shine on us, that we may be saved," expresses the community's hope for restoration and salvation.

In the Epistle reading, Paul reminds the Corinthians of the grace they have received in Christ and encourages them to remain steadfast as they await Christ's return. This passage emphasizes that God's faithfulness will sustain believers until the end.

The Gospel reading from Mark presents Jesus' apocalyptic discourse about the end times. Jesus uses cosmic imagery to describe the dramatic events that will accompany his return. However, the emphasis is not on fear but on watchfulness and readiness. Jesus calls his disciples to "keep watch" because they do not know when the time will come.

## Application

During Advent, we are called to cultivate a spirit of watchfulness and expectation. This involves:

1. **Spiritual Preparation**: Taking time for prayer, reflection, and examination of conscience.
2. **Active Waiting**: Engaging in acts of service and charity that prepare the way for the Lord.
3. **Hopeful Anticipation**: Maintaining hope even in difficult times, trusting in God's promises.
4. **Mindful Presence**: Being attentive to the ways Christ comes to us each day in ordinary moments.

As we light the first candle on the Advent wreath, we are reminded that Christ is the light that shines in the darkness. May this Advent season be a time of renewal and deepening faith as we prepare to celebrate Christ's birth and anticipate his return in glory.
