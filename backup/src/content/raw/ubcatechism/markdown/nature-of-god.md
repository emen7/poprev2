# The Nature of God

## Question 1: What is the nature of God?

God is the First Source and Center of all things and beings. God is primal reality in the spirit world; the source of truth in the mind spheres; and overshadows all throughout the material realms. To all created intelligences, God is a personality, and to the universe of universes, God is the First Source and Center of eternal reality.

## Explanation

The nature of God encompasses several key aspects that help us understand the divine reality:

### God as Infinite and Eternal

God is infinite in power, eternal in nature, absolute in wisdom, and perfect in goodness. The infinity of God encompasses all things and beings, extending throughout all space and time. God's eternal nature means that the divine reality has always existed and will always exist, without beginning or end.

### God as Personal

One of the most profound revelations about God is that the divine nature is personal. God is not an abstract force or impersonal energy but a living, loving personality who seeks relationship with all created beings. This personal nature of God makes possible the profound relationship between the Creator and the created.

### God's Attributes

The divine nature is characterized by several key attributes:

1. **Love**: God's love is the most fundamental and powerful force in the universe, drawing all beings toward divine perfection.

2. **Truth**: God is the source of all truth, both factual and spiritual.

3. **Beauty**: The divine nature is the ultimate source of all beauty, harmony, and goodness.

4. **Goodness**: God's goodness is perfect and complete, the standard by which all moral values are measured.

### God's Relationship with Creation

God relates to creation in multiple ways:

1. As the **Creator** who brings all things into existence
2. As the **Controller** who maintains the physical laws of the universe
3. As the **Upholder** who sustains all reality
4. As the **Father** who loves and nurtures all personal beings

## Practical Application

Understanding the nature of God has profound implications for our lives:

1. **Worship**: Recognizing God's infinite nature and perfect attributes inspires genuine worship and adoration.

2. **Trust**: Understanding God's goodness and love enables us to trust in divine providence even in difficult circumstances.

3. **Growth**: Knowing that God is personal motivates us to develop a personal relationship with the divine through prayer, worship, and service.

4. **Service**: Appreciating God's love for all beings inspires us to serve others as an expression of our love for God.

## Conclusion

The nature of God as infinite, eternal, personal, and perfect provides the foundation for understanding all other spiritual truths. By contemplating and experiencing the divine nature, we grow in our capacity to know God and to become more like the divine pattern in our own lives.
