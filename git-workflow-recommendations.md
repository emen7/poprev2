Git Workflow Recommendations for UB Ecosystem

To ensure we don't lose valuable work and maintain a clear history of changes, here's a recommended git workflow for the UB Ecosystem project.

## Regular Commit Strategy

1. **Commit Frequently**

   - Make small, focused commits that address a single feature or fix
   - Aim to commit at least at the end of each implementation step
   - Use descriptive commit messages that explain what was changed and why

2. **Recommended Commit Message Format**

   ```
   [Component] Brief description of change

   More detailed explanation if needed
   - Bullet points for multiple changes
   - Reference to implementation plan step
   ```

3. **Example Commit Messages**

   ```
   [Header] Implement three-row header system

   - Added TopRowHeader with dual hamburger navigation
   - Created PaperRowHeader for paper title
   - Implemented SectionRowHeader with dynamic updates
   - Relates to Implementation Plan Step 7
   ```

## Branch Strategy

1. **Feature Branches**

   - Create a new branch for each major feature or implementation step
   - Name branches descriptively: `feature/header-system` or `feature/pullup-system`
   - Merge back to main/master when the feature is complete and tested

2. **Implementation Plan Branches**
   - Consider creating branches for each phase of the implementation plan
   - Example: `phase1-mvr`, `phase2-enhanced-reading`, etc.

## Push Strategy

1. **Push Regularly**

   - Push to remote repository at least daily
   - Always push before ending a work session
   - Consider setting up automatic reminders to push changes

2. **Backup Branches**
   - Create backup branches before major refactoring: `backup/before-header-refactor`
   - Push backup branches to remote repository

## Git Commands Quick Reference

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/header-system

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "[Header] Implement three-row header system"

# Push changes to remote
git push -u origin feature/header-system

# Create a backup branch
git checkout -b backup/before-header-refactor
git push -u origin backup/before-header-refactor

# Return to feature branch
git checkout feature/header-system

# Merge completed feature to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/header-system
git push
```

## Git Hooks for Safety

Consider setting up git hooks to:

1. Prevent pushing directly to main/master
2. Run linting and tests before commits
3. Remind about pushing changes after a certain number of commits

## Collaboration Best Practices

1. **Pull Before Starting Work**

   - Always `git pull` before starting new work
   - Resolve any conflicts immediately

2. **Code Reviews**

   - Use pull requests for code reviews when possible
   - Have another team member review changes before merging to main

3. **Documentation**
   - Update implementation plans and documentation as part of commits
   - Keep track of completed steps in the implementation plan

By following these git practices, we can minimize the risk of losing work and maintain a clear history of the project's development.
