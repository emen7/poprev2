# Code Quality Improvement Plan

## Key Deployment Notes

- The `.npmrc` file contains `ignore-scripts=true` which must be removed when implementing search functionality
- ESLint and TypeScript checks are disabled in Next.js config for deployment but should be addressed for better code quality

## Code Quality Improvement Strategy

### Phase 1: Analysis and Prioritization

1. Run ESLint and TypeScript checks locally to get a complete list of issues
2. Categorize issues by severity and impact:
   - Critical: Type errors that could cause runtime failures
   - Important: Unused variables and imports that affect performance
   - Minor: Formatting and style issues

### Phase 2: Fix Critical Issues

1. Address type definition problems:

   - Fix remaining component prop interfaces
   - Properly type functions and their return values
   - Replace `any` types with proper interfaces

2. Fix import/export issues:
   - Ensure all imports point to correct paths
   - Fix named vs. default export confusion

### Phase 3: Fix Important Issues

1. Remove unused variables and imports
2. Fix React Hook dependency arrays
3. Address unescaped entities in JSX

### Phase 4: Re-enable Checks

1. Gradually re-enable TypeScript checks in the Next.js config
2. Gradually re-enable ESLint checks in the Next.js config
3. Set up pre-commit hooks to prevent new issues

## Implementation Approach

- Fix issues incrementally, focusing on one component or module at a time
- Commit and deploy after each significant improvement to ensure stability
- Document complex fixes directly in the code as comments

## Success Criteria

- All critical and important issues resolved
- ESLint and TypeScript checks re-enabled in the build process
- Clean builds without warnings or errors
