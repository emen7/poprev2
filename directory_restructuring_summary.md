# Directory Restructuring Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Created a Comprehensive Plan**

   - Analyzed the current directory structure
   - Identified the issue with nested `src/src/content` directories
   - Designed a cleaner structure with content directly under `src/content`
   - Created a phased approach for implementation

2. **Updated Directory Structure**

   - Confirmed that the target directories already existed:
     - `src/content/scientific/markdown`
     - `src/content/scientific/docx`
     - `src/content/perplexity`
     - `src/content/lectionary`
   - Copied content from the old structure to the new structure:
     - From `src/src/content/raw/scientific/markdown` to `src/content/scientific/markdown`
     - From `src/src/content/raw/perplexity` to `src/content/perplexity`
     - From `src/src/content/raw/lectionary` to `src/content/lectionary`

3. **Updated Code**

   - Modified `src/scripts/build-search-index.ts` to use the new directory structure
   - Modified `src/scripts/build-search-index.js` to use the new directory structure
   - Updated path handling in both files to support backward compatibility
   - Added support for both `.md` and `.docx` file extensions

4. **Generated New Search Index**
   - Successfully ran the build-search-index script
   - Generated a new search index with 7 documents
   - Verified that the search index was written to the correct location

## Current Status

The directory restructuring has been completed successfully. The content has been moved to the new directory structure, and the code has been updated to use the new structure. The search index has been regenerated with the new content.

We're currently rebuilding the Next.js application to ensure that all the changes take effect. Once the build is complete, we'll test the search functionality to verify that everything is working correctly.

## Next Steps

1. **Test Search Functionality**

   - Verify that the search results display correctly
   - Verify that document links work correctly
   - Verify that document content displays correctly

2. **Clean Up Old Directory Structure**

   - Once everything is confirmed to be working, remove the old `src/src/content` directory

3. **Update Documentation**

   - Update any documentation that references the old directory structure
   - Add information about the new directory structure to the project README

4. **Consider Future Improvements**
   - Implement path aliases in `tsconfig.json` for cleaner imports
   - Create a content access layer to abstract the physical file structure
   - Document the directory structure in a `STRUCTURE.md` file
