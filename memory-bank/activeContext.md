# Active Development Context

## Current Focus

- Implementing UI improvements for better user experience
- Refining component behavior for consistency across devices
- Enhancing text formatting options
- Continuing page structure refinements
- Addressing pullup component behavior
- Preparing for next phase of React implementation
- Improving code quality with TypeScript and ESLint

## Current Task Details

Following the implementation of UI improvements and code quality enhancements, focus is now on:

- Finalizing any remaining UI adjustments
- Preparing for the React implementation phase
- Optimizing performance of interactive elements
- Testing enhanced UI across different environments
- Planning for advanced features in the React implementation
- Continuing to improve TypeScript and ESLint configuration
- Addressing remaining code quality issues in a phased approach

## Active Components

- Section Titles: Now using natural case instead of uppercase
- Pullup Component: Improved with reduced height, always-visible handle, and better state management
- Tab Layout: Adjusted for better cohesion with adjacent labels
- Text Alignment: New settings options for alignment preferences
- Paragraph Numbering: Enhanced display with separate column for notes indicators
- Settings Panel: Expanded with new text formatting options

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring consistent behavior of enhanced pullup component across devices
- Optimizing text alignment options for different content types
- Planning smooth transition to React implementation
- Maintaining consistent formatting across theme changes
- Ensuring performance with enhanced formatting features
- Testing complex interactions in the revised UI
- Balancing strict TypeScript checking with development velocity
- Addressing unused variables and parameters without breaking functionality
- Ensuring consistent code quality across the monorepo
