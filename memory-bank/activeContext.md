# Active Development Context

## Current Focus

- Redesigning page structure for better consistency
- Implementing clean component hierarchy
- Creating a standardized layout system
- Addressing positioning inconsistencies between environments
- Implementing optimized reading experience

## Current Task Details

Working on page structure redesign for the UB Reader application, focusing on:

- Creating a clean, consistent page structure from top to bottom
- Implementing a properly centered reading area with optimal width
- Developing a text-only pullup component with adjustable height
- Ensuring consistent positioning between localhost and Vercel deployment
- Using a full paper implementation to validate the design

## Active Components

- Permanent Title Bar: Fixed position header with app title
- Paper Bar: Secondary header showing current paper information
- Reading Area: Main content container with optimal width
- Pullup Footer: Expandable panel with text-only initial state

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring consistent positioning between localhost and Vercel deployment
- Creating a clean div structure with minimal nesting
- Balancing mobile and desktop experiences with the same core components
- Implementing proper width constraints for optimal reading
- Ensuring the pullup component works consistently across devices
