  - [x] Added text alignment options (left, right, justified)
  - [x] Set left alignment as default
  - [x] Implemented CSS classes for different text alignments
- [x] Create basic settings UI for text formatting

### ðŸ”„ In Progress (Transition to React Phase)

- [ ] Test improvements across environments (localhost and Vercel)
- [ ] Finalize any remaining UI adjustments
- [ ] Create core React component structure for UI improvements
- [ ] Prepare documentation for React implementation phase
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations for enhanced components

### ðŸ“… Upcoming Tasks (React Phase)

- [ ] Convert essential layout elements to React components
- [ ] Implement advanced features directly in React:
  - [ ] Settings functionality (theme persistence, font customization)
  - [ ] Content management (dynamic loading, pagination)
  - [ ] Pullup advanced features (state persistence, notes integration)
- [ ] Implement state management for interactive elements
- [ ] Integrate with existing content system
- [ ] Test with full paper content
- [ ] Optimize for deployment

### Dependencies and Blockers

- **Dependencies**:

  - âœ… HTML refinements completed before React implementation
  - âœ… Paragraph numbering and pullup behavior validated in HTML
  - Clean component hierarchy needed for React conversion
  - Component performance optimization before scaling

- **Resolved Issues**:

  - âœ… Positioning inconsistencies addressed with standardized layout
  - âœ… Pullup behavior improved with consistent state management
  - âœ… Paragraph numbering refined with separate notes column

- **Current Blockers**:
  - Complex component interactions in the React implementation
  - Performance considerations with full paper content
  - Cross-device testing needed for enhanced UI

## Next Sprint: Component Performance Optimization

### Planned Tasks

- [ ] Implement React.memo for performance-critical components
- [ ] Optimize context providers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Implement code splitting for better load times
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks and monitoring

## Future Roadmap

1. Component library standardization
2. Advanced state management patterns
3. Enhanced accessibility compliance
4. Performance optimization
5. Comprehensive testing strategy
6. Mobile-optimized reading experience
7. Side-docked Notes for desktop (future enhancement)
