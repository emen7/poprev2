# UB Reader Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the navigation and settings components to be integrated into the UB Reader. It covers various testing methodologies, test cases, and quality assurance processes to ensure the implementation meets requirements and functions correctly across different devices and scenarios.

## Testing Methodologies

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit tests will verify that individual components function correctly in isolation.

#### Navigation Component Unit Tests

- Test part toggle functionality (expand/collapse)
- Test active/inactive part management
- Test paper selection
- Test section dropdown functionality
- Test navigation panel open/close

#### Settings Component Unit Tests

- Test settings panel open/close
- Test theme selection
- Test font size selection
- Test font style selection
- Test line spacing selection
- Test text width selection
- Test extension settings rendering

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration tests will verify that components work correctly together and with the existing Reader architecture.

#### Navigation-Settings Integration

- Test that opening navigation closes settings panel
- Test that opening settings closes navigation panel
- Test that overlay works correctly for both panels

#### Navigation-Content Integration

- Test that selecting a section scrolls to the correct position
- Test that sticky headers update correctly when scrolling

### 3. End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests will verify the complete user flows and interactions.

#### Navigation Flows

- Test navigating from part to paper to section
- Test using breadcrumbs for navigation
- Test using section dropdown for navigation
- Test expanding/collapsing parts

#### Settings Flows

- Test changing multiple settings in sequence
- Test saving and loading settings
- Test resetting settings to defaults

#### Combined Flows

- Test navigation after changing settings
- Test settings changes after navigating to different content

### 4. Responsive Testing

Responsive tests will verify that components function correctly across different devices and screen sizes.

#### Mobile Testing

- Test navigation panel on small screens
- Test settings panel on small screens
- Test touch interactions
- Test overlay behavior

#### Tablet Testing

- Test navigation panel on medium screens
- Test settings panel on medium screens
- Test touch and mouse interactions

#### Desktop Testing

- Test navigation panel on large screens
- Test settings panel on large screens
- Test mouse interactions
- Test keyboard navigation

### 5. Accessibility Testing

Accessibility tests will verify that components are usable by people with disabilities.

#### Keyboard Navigation

- Test tabbing through all interactive elements
- Test keyboard shortcuts
- Test focus management
- Test escape key to close panels

#### Screen Reader Testing

- Test with NVDA on Windows
- Test with VoiceOver on macOS
- Test with TalkBack on Android
- Test ARIA attributes and roles

#### Color Contrast

- Test contrast ratios in light theme
- Test contrast ratios in dark theme
- Test focus indicators

## Test Cases

### Navigation Component Test Cases

1. **Panel Opening/Closing**

   - When hamburger icon is clicked, navigation panel should slide in
   - When overlay is clicked, navigation panel should close
   - When escape key is pressed, navigation panel should close
   - When settings panel is opened, navigation panel should close

2. **Part Management**

   - When part toggle is clicked, part content should expand/collapse
   - When inactive part is expanded, it should move to active position
   - When active part is collapsed, it should remain in active position
   - Only one part should be expanded at a time

3. **Paper Selection**

   - When paper is clicked, it should be highlighted
   - When paper is clicked, content should update to show that paper
   - Current paper should be visually indicated

4. **Section Navigation**
   - When section is selected from dropdown, content should scroll to that section
   - Section dropdown should show all sections in current paper
   - Current section should be highlighted in dropdown

### Settings Component Test Cases

1. **Panel Opening/Closing**

   - When gear icon is clicked, settings panel should slide in
   - When overlay is clicked, settings panel should close
   - When escape key is pressed, settings panel should close
   - When navigation panel is opened, settings panel should close

2. **Theme Settings**

   - When dark theme is selected, UI should update to dark theme
   - When light theme is selected, UI should update to light theme
   - Theme selection should persist across page reloads

3. **Typography Settings**

   - When font size is changed, content text size should update
   - When font style is changed, content font should update
   - When line spacing is changed, content line height should update
   - Typography settings should persist across page reloads

4. **Layout Settings**

   - When text width is changed, content width should update
   - Layout settings should persist across page reloads

5. **Extension Settings**
   - Extension-specific settings should render correctly
   - When extension settings are changed, extension behavior should update
   - Extension settings should persist across page reloads

## Performance Testing

### 1. Load Time Testing

- Measure time to load navigation structure
- Measure time to open/close panels
- Measure time to apply settings changes

### 2. Memory Usage

- Monitor memory usage with large documents
- Check for memory leaks during navigation
- Verify cleanup when components unmount

### 3. Animation Performance

- Test smoothness of panel animations
- Test scroll performance with sticky headers
- Test performance on low-end devices

## Browser Compatibility Testing

Test all functionality on the following browsers:

- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)
- Mobile Chrome (Android)
- Mobile Safari (iOS)

## Testing Tools

### Automated Testing

- **Jest**: For unit and integration tests
- **React Testing Library**: For component testing
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing
- **Storybook**: For component development and visual testing

### Accessibility Testing

- Developers run integration tests locally before submitting PRs
- Code review includes test coverage review

### 2. Continuous Integration

- Automated tests run on every PR
- Performance tests run on scheduled basis
- Accessibility tests run on every PR

### 3. QA Testing

- Manual testing of all features
- Exploratory testing to find edge cases
- Cross-browser testing
- Device testing

### 4. User Acceptance Testing

- Testing with representative users
- Gathering feedback on usability
- Identifying any accessibility issues

## Test Documentation

### Test Plans

- Detailed test plans for each component
- Test matrices for cross-browser/device testing
- Accessibility test checklists

### Test Reports

- Test execution reports
- Bug reports with reproduction steps
- Performance test results

## Bug Tracking and Resolution

### Bug Prioritization

- **P0**: Critical issues blocking functionality
- **P1**: Major issues affecting core functionality
- **P2**: Minor issues affecting non-core functionality
- **P3**: Cosmetic issues

### Resolution Process

1. Bug reported with reproduction steps
2. Bug triaged and assigned
3. Developer fixes bug
4. Tests written to prevent regression
5. QA verifies fix
6. Bug closed

## Regression Testing

- Automated regression tests for all fixed bugs
- Regular full regression testing before major releases
- Focused regression testing for affected areas after bug fixes

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality, performance, and accessibility of the navigation and settings components. By following this strategy, we can deliver a robust implementation that meets user needs and technical requirements.
