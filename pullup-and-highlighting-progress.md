## Completed Tasks (April 9, 2025)

### 1. Pullup Panel Improvements

- Added max-width (1200px) to the pullup panel to respect page width
- Centered the panel on larger screens
- Made tabs closer together and left-aligned
- Created standalone HTML example for the pullup panel

### 2. Highlighting Feature Implementation

- Added highlighting option to the selection menu
- Implemented color picker for selecting highlight colors
- Created different highlighting behaviors for light and dark modes:
  - Light mode: Background highlighting
  - Dark mode: Text color highlighting
- Set text selection color in dark mode to cyan (#00e5ff)
- Created a complementary color palette with cyan as the primary color
- Created standalone HTML example for the highlighting feature

## Next Steps

### 1. Integration with UB Reader

- Integrate the pullup panel with the main UB Reader application
- Connect the highlighting feature with the content renderer
- Ensure proper interaction between the selection menu and the pullup panel

### 2. Additional Features

- Implement persistence for highlights, notes, and quotes
- Add ability to view and manage highlights in the pullup panel
- Consider adding a dedicated "Highlights" tab to the pullup panel

### 3. Testing and Refinement

- Test the features with real UB content
- Ensure proper responsiveness on different screen sizes
- Gather feedback and make refinements

## Technical Notes

### Pullup Panel

- The pullup panel uses CSS transitions for smooth animations
- It supports both fixed (slide-up) and persistent modes
- The panel can be resized by dragging the handle at the top

### Highlighting Feature

- Highlighting is implemented using CSS classes
- Different styles are applied based on dark/light mode
- The selection menu shows a color picker when the highlight option is selected
- The color palette includes: cyan, pink, orange, green, and purple

### Standalone Examples

- `packages/ui/src/examples/pullup-tabs-standalone.html` - Demonstrates the pullup panel
- `packages/ui/src/examples/highlight-standalone.html` - Demonstrates the highlighting feature

## Questions for Tomorrow

- Should we add a dedicated "Highlights" tab to the pullup panel?
- How should we handle persistence of highlights across sessions?
- Should we add the ability to filter or search through highlights?
- How should highlights be displayed in the content when loaded from storage?
