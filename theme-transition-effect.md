# Theme Transition Effect

## Description

The theme transition effect would create a smooth visual change when switching between themes (dark, light, sepia) rather than an abrupt change. This provides a more polished user experience and reduces visual jarring when changing themes.

## Implementation Details

1. **CSS Transition Property**: Add a transition property to the elements that change color when themes switch:

```css
body,
.reading-area,
.title-bar,
.paper-bar,
.pullup-footer {
  transition:
    background-color 0.3s ease,
    color 0.3s ease,
    border-color 0.3s ease;
}
```

2. **Transition Timing**: The 0.3s duration provides a noticeable but not distracting transition. The "ease" timing function creates a natural-feeling acceleration and deceleration.

3. **Properties to Transition**: We'll transition:
   - background-color (for all containers)
   - color (for text)
   - border-color (for borders and dividers)

## Implementation Recommendation

**Implement Now**: I recommend implementing the transition effect as part of the initial theme implementation for these reasons:

1. It's a small addition (just a few lines of CSS)
2. It's easier to add now than retrofit later
3. It significantly improves the user experience
4. It helps users visually understand the theme change is occurring

The transition effect requires no additional JavaScript and has minimal performance impact, making it a high-value, low-cost enhancement to include in the initial implementation.
