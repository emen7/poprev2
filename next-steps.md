# Next Steps for UB Reader Development

## ✅ Resolved: Next.js Serialization Issues

All Next.js serialization errors have been successfully resolved by standardizing on the global PullupContext and fixing export issues.

### ✅ PullupProvider Export Issue - RESOLVED

**Error (FIXED):**

```
./components/traditional-reader/TraditionalReader.tsx
Attempted import error: 'PullupProvider' is not exported from '../pullup' (imported as 'PullupProvider').
```

**Solution Implemented:**

- Updated the import in TraditionalReader.tsx to use the correct path from the global context
- Added proper export of PullupProvider from the barrel file in '../pullup' to maintain backward compatibility
- Verified that all components using PullupProvider have the correct import paths

## Additional Considerations

### Component Boundary Review

- Review all components that use PullupContext to ensure they have the proper "use client" directive
- Verify that server components are not directly using client-only features
- Ensure proper data flow between server and client components

### Testing

- Thoroughly test the Pullup functionality after fixing the remaining issue
- Verify that all tabs (Notes, Settings, etc.) work correctly
- Check that text selection and highlighting features function as expected

### Documentation

- Update component documentation to reflect the standardized context usage
- Add comments in key files explaining the context architecture
- Consider creating a diagram showing the relationship between PullupContext and its consumers
