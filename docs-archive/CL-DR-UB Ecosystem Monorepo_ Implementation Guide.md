# UB Ecosystem Monorepo: Implementation Guide

This document provides structured guidance for implementing the UB Ecosystem monorepo architecture, focusing on critical components and practical implementation steps.

## THESE ARE SUGGESTIONS, NOT DIRECTIVES

The following represents best practices for implementation but respects your autonomy for actual coding choices. Please adapt these suggestions based on your expertise and the specific requirements of the project.

## Core Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Monorepo Foundation (Critical)

**Structure:**

- `/apps` - Contains all reader applications
- `/packages` - Contains shared functionality
- `/content` - Contains publication content sources

**Critical Configuration:**

- Turborepo or Nx for monorepo management
- Shared ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript configurations
- Workspace-aware package resolution
- Selective build and test capabilities

**Implementation Notes:**

- Begin with minimal, functioning configuration
- Prioritize developer experience and build performance
- Implement proper CI/CD pipeline with caching and selective builds

### Phase 2: Essential Shared Packages (Critical)

**1. content-transformer:**

```
packages/
  content-transformer/
    src/
      transformers/ - Format-specific transformers
      utils/ - Shared utility functions
      index.ts - Main entry point
    tests/
    package.json
```

**2. data-models:**

```
packages/
  data-models/
    src/
      document.ts - Core document model
      user.ts - User models
      annotation.ts - Annotation models
      settings.ts - Settings models
    tests/
    package.json
```

**3. ui-components:**

```
packages/
  ui-components/
    src/
      reader/ - Core reader components
      navigation/ - Navigation components
      annotations/ - Annotation components
      common/ - Shared UI elements
    tests/
    package.json
```

**4. reference-parser:**

```
packages/
  reference-parser/
    src/
      parsers/ - Publication-specific parsers
      utils/ - Utility functions
      index.ts - Main entry point
    tests/
    package.json
```

### Phase 3: Base Reader Application (Critical)

**Structure:**

```
apps/
  ub-reader/
    src/
      components/ - App-specific components
      pages/ - Page components
      hooks/ - Custom hooks
      styles/ - Application styles
      utils/ - App-specific utilities
    public/
    package.json
```

**Core Functions:**

- Content display with proper formatting
- Basic navigation (paper, section, paragraph)
- Offline content storage
- Simple annotation system
- Responsive design for multiple devices

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### State Management Approach

**Recommendation:**

- Context API for UI state and component sharing
- Zustand or similar lightweight store for global state
- Avoid overly complex state management patterns initially

**Storage Strategy:**

- IndexedDB for content and annotations
- Local Storage for user preferences
- Well-defined schema that supports future synchronization

### Performance Considerations

**Critical Optimizations:**

- Implement virtualization for large documents
- Lazy load content sections
- Optimize bundle size through proper code splitting
- Implement efficient memoization patterns

**Memory Management:**

- Implement document chunking for large publications
- Use proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- Monitor and manage memory usage patterns

### Offline-First Implementation

**Strategy:**

- Download and store entire publications for offline use
- Implement Service Worker for asset caching
- Build robust synchronization for annotations with conflict resolution
- Provide clear visual indicators of online/offline status

## Development Roadmap (Prioritized)

### Immediate Focus (MVP)

1. Establish monorepo structure and shared configurations
2. Implement content transformer with basic markdown support
3. Create essential reader UI components
4. Develop basic reference parser for UB-specific references
5. Build minimal viable UB Reader with offline support

### Secondary Priorities

1. Enhance annotation system with highlighting, notes, and bookmarks
2. Implement basic search functionality
3. Add settings and preferences
4. Create the scientific reader application

### Later Development

1. Audio integration
2. Advanced search capabilities
3. Cross-publication features
4. Plugin system
5. Additional reader applications

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing:**

- Jest for package and component testing
- High coverage for critical utilities (transformers, parsers)

**Integration Testing:**

- React Testing Library for component integration
- Cross-package integration tests

**E2E Testing:**

- Cypress for critical user flows
- Focus on reading experience and navigation

## Technical Considerations

**Browser Compatibility:**

- Target modern evergreen browsers
- Use progressive enhancement for features
- Implement appropriate polyfills for essential functionality

**Accessibility:**

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as minimum standard
- Keyboard navigation for all features
- Screen reader optimization for reading experience
- High contrast mode support

## Conclusion

This implementation guide focuses on the most critical aspects of the UB Ecosystem. The approach emphasizes building a solid foundation first, with shared components and essential functionality, before expanding to additional features and publications.

Remember that the ultimate goal is to provide an exemplary reading experience across multiple publication types while maintaining code efficiency and developer productivity through proper architecture.
