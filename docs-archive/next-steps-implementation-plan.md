# Next Steps: Implementation Plan

This document outlines the immediate next steps to implement the revised repository cleanup plan, with a focus on resolving VS Code issues and continuing package development.

## Immediate Actions (Today)

### 1. Resolve VS Code and TypeScript Issues

1. **Close VS Code**:

   - Save any unsaved work
   - Close VS Code completely

2. **Clean Up VS Code State** (optional but recommended):

   - Delete `.vscode/.roamingState` directory if it exists
   - This will reset VS Code's state and remove any references to non-existent files

3. **Implement VS Code Settings**:

   - Create `.vscode` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Create `.vscode/settings.json` with the configuration from `vscode-setup-instructions.md`
   - Create `.vscode/extensions.json` to recommend extensions

4. **Restart VS Code**:
   - Open VS Code
   - Open the project
   - Verify that the TypeScript formatter conflict is resolved

### 2. Verify Package Migration

1. **Check Content Transformer Package**:

   - Verify all files have been properly migrated from `src/lib/document-transformer/` to `packages/content-transformer/src/`
   - Check that the package structure follows the guidelines in `package-development-guide.md`

2. **Check UI Package**:
   - Verify the migration status of UI components from `src/components/` to `packages/ui/src/`
   - Identify any components that still need to be migrated

## Short-Term Actions (This Week)

### 1. Complete Package Setup

1. **Update Package Configurations**:

   - Review and update `package.json` for each package
   - Create or update `tsconfig.json` for each package
   - Create or update README files for each package

2. **Implement Testing Infrastructure**:

   - Set up Jest for each package
   - Create initial test files

3. **Complete UI Package Migration**:
   - Finish migrating any remaining components
   - Update imports and exports

### 2. Decide on Sandbox Strategy

1. **Evaluate Sandbox Usage**:

   - Determine if the sandbox is needed for development or testing
   - If not needed, plan for its removal

2. **If Keeping Sandbox**:

   - Clean up and simplify the sandbox
   - Fix any import or TypeScript errors
   - Ensure it properly uses the shared packages

3. **If Removing Sandbox**:
   - Back up any potentially useful code
   - Remove the sandbox directory
   - Update documentation

## Medium-Term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. Package Development

1. **Develop Core Functionality**:

   - Implement missing features in each package
   - Follow the guidelines in `package-development-guide.md`

2. **Write Comprehensive Tests**:

   - Create unit tests for each function and component
   - Create integration tests for package interactions

3. **Document APIs**:
   - Create detailed API documentation
   - Provide usage examples

### 2. Package Integration

1. **Update Inter-Package Dependencies**:

   - Ensure packages properly depend on each other
   - Update imports to use the correct package paths

2. **Create Example Usage**:
   - Create simple examples of how to use each package
   - These can be part of the package documentation or separate example files

## Long-Term Actions (Next Month)

### 1. App Development

1. **Begin App Development**:

   - Start with the reader app
   - Ensure it properly uses the shared packages

2. **Create App-Specific Components**:
   - Develop components specific to each app
   - Avoid duplicating functionality across apps

### 2. Deployment Configuration

1. **Set Up CI/CD**:

   - Configure GitHub Actions or other CI/CD system
   - Set up automated testing and deployment

2. **Create Deployment Documentation**:
   - Document the deployment process
   - Include environment setup instructions

## Success Metrics

Track the following metrics to measure progress:

1. **Package Completion**:

   - Percentage of planned features implemented
   - Test coverage percentage
   - Documentation completeness

2. **Code Quality**:

   - Number of TypeScript errors
   - ESLint warnings and errors
   - Code review feedback

3. **Developer Experience**:
   - Time spent resolving environment issues
   - Build and test execution time
   - Feedback from developers

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, we will:

1. Resolve the immediate VS Code and TypeScript issues
2. Complete the package migration and development
3. Establish a clean, maintainable repository structure
4. Set the foundation for successful app development

The focus on packages first will ensure we have a solid foundation before moving on to app development. This approach will reduce duplication, improve code sharing, and enhance the overall developer experience.
