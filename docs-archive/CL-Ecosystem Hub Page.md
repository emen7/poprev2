**THESE ARE SUGGESTIONS, NOT DIRECTIVES:**

### 6. Ecosystem Hub Page

Instead of implementing cross-publication features, I recommend creating a dedicated "Ecosystem Hub" page that serves as an informational gateway to the UB Ecosystem. This page would:

- Provide a comprehensive overview of the entire UB Ecosystem
- Clearly describe each component's purpose and unique features
- Serve as a launch point for users to discover related applications

**Implementation Components:**

1. **Main Hub Structure**:
    - Clean, visually appealing layout with distinct sections for each ecosystem component
    - Consistent branding that visually ties all publications together
    - Clear navigation between sections
2. **UB Reader Section**:
    - Description of the core UB Reader application and its primary features
    - Screenshots showcasing the reading experience
    - Direct download/access links
    - Brief explanation of its role as the flagship application
3. **Publications Directory**:
    - Individual cards or sections for each publication reader (Scientific, Lectionary, UB Catechism, and Popular Revelation Magazine.)
    - Brief descriptions of the specialized features of each publication
    - Visual examples of content presentation
    - Direct links to access each publication reader
4. **Almanac-New Spotlight**:
    - Featured section highlighting the almanac-new as a special publication
    - Overview of its purpose and content structure
    - Visual previews of its unique features
    - Explanation of how it complements the broader ecosystem
5. **Technical Information**:
    - Optional expandable sections with technical details for developers
    - Information about the architecture and design principles
    - Resources for contributors or content creators

This approach maintains the independence of each application while still providing users with a comprehensive understanding of the entire ecosystem. The Hub page would serve as both an informational resource and a discovery tool, helping users find the specific readers that best suit their needs.

The Hub could be implemented as a standalone web page, an integrated component within each reader application, or both, depending on your distribution strategy and user onboarding processes.
