## Project Overview

### Vision

Create a unified, high-performance ecosystem for reading and studying publications that provides an intuitive user experience with both Traditional and Modern formatting options while ensuring content integrity and accessibility across all device types.

### Core Principles

1. **Content Integrity**: Maintain absolute fidelity to the original text while providing enhanced formatting options
2. **Unified Experience**: Create a consistent user interface that works across all publication types
3. **Performance First**: Ensure optimal performance even with large documents and on resource-constrained devices
4. **Offline Capability**: Provide full functionality without requiring constant internet connectivity
5. **Extensibility**: Build a foundation that can easily accommodate new publications and features

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1: Unified UI Foundation** - Create the core UI components and layout system
2. **Phase 2: Content Management System** - Implement content storage, retrieval, and search capabilities
3. **Phase 3: Reader Experience Refinement** - Enhance the reading experience with advanced features and optimizations

## Implementation Strategy

### Architectural Approach

The UB Ecosystem will be implemented as a monorepo with shared packages for core functionality and separate applications for different reader experiences. This approach ensures code reuse while allowing for specialized implementations where needed.

    B --> G[Reference Parser]
    C --> H[UB Reader]
    C --> I[Scientific Reader]
    C --> J[Future Readers]
```

### Development Methodology

The project will follow an iterative development approach with the following characteristics:

1. **Component-First Development**: Build and test individual components before integration
2. **Continuous Integration**: Implement automated testing and deployment
3. **Feature Flagging**: Use feature flags for gradual rollout of new functionality
4. **User Feedback Loops**: Incorporate user testing and feedback throughout development

### Technical Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React with Next.js
- **State Management**: React Context API and Zustand
- **Styling**: CSS Modules or Styled Components
- **Storage**: IndexedDB with localStorage fallback
- **Build System**: Turborepo for monorepo management
- **Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress

## Phase Integration

### Phase Relationships

The three implementation phases are designed to build upon each other, with each phase providing essential functionality for subsequent phases:

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

1. **Performance with Large Documents**

   - **Mitigation**: Implement virtualization and document chunking early
   - **Contingency**: Fallback to simplified rendering for very large documents

2. **Browser Compatibility Issues**

   - **Mitigation**: Use feature detection and polyfills
   - **Contingency**: Provide graceful degradation for unsupported features

3. **Content Formatting Complexity**

   - **Mitigation**: Create comprehensive test suite with various content types
   - **Contingency**: Implement fallback rendering for complex content

4. **Offline Synchronization Conflicts**

   - **Mitigation**: Implement robust conflict resolution strategies
   - **Contingency**: Provide manual conflict resolution UI

5. **Scope Creep**
   - **Mitigation**: Clearly define MVP features and use feature flagging
   - **Contingency**: Prioritize features and defer non-essential items

### Risk Monitoring
