# Reader Implementation Plan (Updated)

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for implementing both the UB Reader and Scientific Reader applications, incorporating design elements and functionality from the improved-demo.html prototype. The UB Reader will be developed first as the foundation, with its design informing and supporting the subsequent Scientific Reader development.

## Key Design Elements from Improved Demo

The implementation will incorporate the following key design elements from the improved-demo.html prototype:

1. **Navigation Menu (Hamburger Menu)**:

   - Hierarchical structure with parts and papers
   - Fixed top container for active parts
   - Fixed bottom container for inactive parts
   - Expandable/collapsible sections

2. **Sticky Headers**:

   - Persistent display of part title, paper title, and section title while scrolling
   - Proper z-index management for overlapping elements

3. **Modern UI Design**:

   - Clean, modern interface with consistent styling
   - Dark theme with good contrast for readability
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes

4. **Reading Experience**:

   - Clear typography and spacing for comfortable reading
   - Paragraph numbering with proper alignment
   - Section navigation with smooth scrolling

5. **Settings Panel**:
   - Comprehensive display and reading settings
   - Theme, font size, font style options
   - Line spacing and text width controls

## Modern Theme Implementation

The reader will offer two distinct theme options for content formatting:

1. **Modern Theme** (Default):

   - Sans-serif font for improved digital legibility
   - Increased boldness for italicized words and words in ALL CAPS
   - Proper alignment for numbered lists and tables (numbers under numbers, text under text)
   - Visual indicators (faint lines) between paragraphs that indicate topic changes
   - Text that wraps more naturally for better readability
   - Optimized for reading on digital devices, especially phones and tablets

2. **Traditional Theme** (Fallback option):
   - Formatting that matches the original book's presentation
   - Numbered lists displayed as numbered paragraphs
   - Standard emphasis for italicized text
   - Traditional paragraph spacing without visual indicators
   - Preserves the historical presentation familiar to long-time readers

The implementation will include:

1. **Typography System**:

   - Configuration to switch between sans-serif (modern) and serif (traditional) font families
   - Conditional styling for emphasis (bold italics in modern, standard italics in traditional)
   - Proper font scaling across device sizes in both themes

2. **List and Table Formatting**:

   - Two distinct rendering approaches for numbered lists:
     - Modern: Proper column alignment with numbers under numbers and text under text
     - Traditional: Paragraph-style with numbers inline with text
   - Proper table formatting in the modern theme while preserving original formatting in traditional theme
   - Special handling for lists with rows of dots between elements

3. **Theme Toggle Component**:
   - Easily accessible theme toggle in the settings menu
   - Brief descriptions of each theme option
   - Visual preview of how each theme affects the text
   - Smooth transitions when switching between themes
