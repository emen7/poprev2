# Publication Readers Development Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for developing the publication-specific readers for Scientific, Lectionary, Catechism, and PopRev publications. Each reader will build upon the generic reader component while adding publication-specific features and branding.

## Current Status

The generic reader component is being developed in `packages/ui/src/document-reader`, and the UB Reader application is being implemented in `apps/reader`. The publication-specific readers will be developed in their respective application directories:

- Scientific Reader: `apps/publications/scientific`
- Lectionary Reader: `apps/publications/lectionary`
- Catechism Reader: `apps/publications/catechism`
- PopRev Reader: `apps/publications/poprev`

   - Add features incrementally
   - Test and refine each feature before moving to the next

3. **User-Centered Design**

   - Focus on user needs and preferences
   - Conduct user research and testing
   - Gather feedback throughout the development process
   - Iterate based on user feedback

4. **Code Reuse**
   - Maximize code reuse across publication readers
   - Create shared components and utilities
   - Use inheritance and composition for specialization
   - Avoid duplication of functionality

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Common Infrastructure** - 3 weeks
2. **Phase 2: Scientific Reader** - 4 weeks
3. **Phase 3: Lectionary Reader** - 4 weeks
4. **Phase 4: Catechism Reader** - 4 weeks
5. **Phase 5: PopRev Reader** - 4 weeks
6. **Phase 6: Integration and Testing** - 3 weeks

Total estimated time: 24 weeks

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Content Format Variations**

   - Risk: Different content formats requiring specialized handling
   - Mitigation: Create flexible content adapters and transformers

2. **Feature Overlap**

   - Risk: Duplication of features across publication readers
   - Mitigation: Identify common features and move them to the base component

3. **Performance Impact**

   - Risk: Publication-specific features impacting performance
   - Mitigation: Implement features with performance in mind, use lazy loading

4. **Maintenance Complexity**
   - Risk: Multiple publication readers increasing maintenance complexity
   - Mitigation: Use shared components and utilities, maintain consistent architecture

## Conclusion

This plan provides a detailed roadmap for developing the publication-specific readers for Scientific, Lectionary, Catechism, and PopRev publications. By following this plan, we can create high-quality, feature-rich readers that provide excellent user experiences for each publication while maximizing code reuse and maintainability.

The development of these publication readers will build upon the foundation laid by the generic reader component and the UB Reader application, ensuring consistency across the ecosystem while allowing for publication-specific customizations and features.
