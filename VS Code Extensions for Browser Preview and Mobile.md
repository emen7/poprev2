# VS Code Extensions for Browser Preview and Mobile Testing

When developing web applications with Roo Code in VS Code, having reliable browser preview functionality is essential, especially when the Live Server extension isn't properly handling auxiliary files. Several alternative extensions can provide better browser preview capabilities and even allow testing on mobile devices.

## Browser Preview Extensions

### Live Preview

Live Preview is Microsoft's official alternative to Live Server and often handles auxiliary files more reliably. It provides a built-in browser preview directly within VS Code and updates in real-time as you make changes to your code.

Key features:

- Embedded browser preview within VS Code
- Real-time updates without manual refresh
- Better handling of auxiliary files and complex project structures
- Supports various web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

To set it up:

1. Install the extension from the marketplace
2. Open your HTML file
3. Click the "Show Preview" button in the editor or right-click and select "Show Preview"

### Browser Preview

This extension embeds a real Chromium-based browser inside VS Code, giving you a more accurate representation of how your site will appear in Chrome.

Key features:

- Full Chrome DevTools integration
- Accurate rendering of your web application
- Syncs with your editor cursor position
- Supports debugging directly in the preview

### Preview on Web Server

This extension allows you to preview your web application on multiple browsers simultaneously, which can be useful for cross-browser testing.

## Mobile Testing Extensions

### Browser Sync

While not a VS Code extension itself, you can integrate Browser Sync with VS Code to enable mobile testing:

1. Install Browser Sync globally: `npm install -g browser-sync`
2. Add a task in VS Code's tasks.json:

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "browser-sync",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "browser-sync start --server --files '**/*.html, **/*.css, **/*.js'",
      "problemMatcher": []
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Run the task and access your site from any device on your local network using the IP address and port provided

### Local Tunnel

Local Tunnel creates a public URL for your localhost server, allowing you to test your application on mobile devices even outside your local network:

1. Install localtunnel: `npm install -g localtunnel`
2. Start your local server (using any method)
3. Run: `lt --port 3000` (replace 3000 with your server port)
4. Use the provided URL on any device

## Integrated Solutions

### Five Server

Five Server is an enhanced version of Live Server with better handling of auxiliary files and improved performance.

Key features:

- Better handling of complex file structures
- HTTPS support out of the box
- Custom routing capabilities
- Mobile device access via local network

### Vite

While not strictly a VS Code extension, Vite can be integrated into your workflow:

1. Install Vite: `npm create vite@latest my-project`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Access from mobile devices using your computer's IP address and the port Vite is running on

Vite offers extremely fast hot module replacement and excellent handling of various file types and dependencies.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you're experiencing issues with auxiliary files not loading:

1. Check your file paths - ensure they're relative to the HTML file or use absolute paths
2. Verify CORS settings - some extensions handle CORS differently
3. Check for special characters in filenames or paths
4. Ensure all necessary files are in the workspace folder being served

## Setting Up for Mobile Testing

For the best mobile testing experience:

1. Install Five Server or use Browser Sync
2. Ensure your computer and mobile device are on the same network
3. Find your computer's local IP address (usually starts with 192.168.x.x)
4. Access your site from your mobile device using that IP and the port number
5. For testing outside your network, use Local Tunnel or ngrok

These solutions should provide reliable alternatives to Live Server and enable you to preview your Roo Code-generated HTML files both on your desktop and mobile devices.
