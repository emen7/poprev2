# Response Guidance for Architect's Implementation Questions

Based on our design specification for the UB Reader's new three-row model, here's how I recommend responding to the architect's questions:

## Addressing Element Structure

"We should use the existing h3.section-title elements and add the section-heading class to them. This maintains compatibility with existing styles while allowing us to target these elements specifically for the Intersection Observer implementation. This approach minimizes refactoring while enabling the new functionality."

## Theme Integration

"Let's maintain the current theme variables and extend them with our new monochromatic styling requirements. For the Dark Theme (default), we should add variables for the slightly darker title colors and paragraph numbers. This evolutionary approach preserves existing theme functionality while implementing our new design direction."

## Implementation Approach

"Focus primarily on the Intersection Observer API implementation as it's the most performant solution. It has excellent browser support now (97%+ globally), but as a precaution, include the throttled scroll event listener as a fallback that only activates if Intersection Observer isn't available."

## UI Element Preservation

"We should preserve the core navigation functionality (Book Hamburger, Section HB, paper navigation arrows) but restructure them into the three-row layout as specified. The section title dynamic updating replaces the current sticky section element that has functionality issues."

## Part 1 Line Removal

"Yes, we're removing the 'Part 1' line completely since this information is already accessible via the Papers Hamburger menu. This simplifies the UI and reduces redundancy while maintaining access to the information through the navigation system."

## Additional Implementation Notes

"When implementing the dynamic Section Row, ensure it maintains a consistent height even when no section is visible (showing the faded '(intro)' text). This prevents layout shifts when scrolling between sections.

Also, please consider how this design will scale across all 196 Papers plus the Foreword. We should implement this as reusable components that can be efficiently applied across all content, likely through a higher-order component or template that follows the same structure."
