				<td class="quotation">Stoicism was the superior philosophy of the better classes. The Stoics believed that 
				a controlling Reason-Fate dominated all nature. They taught that the soul of man was divine; that it was 
				imprisoned in the evil body of physical nature. Man&#39;s soul achieved liberty by living in harmony with 
				nature, with God; thus virtue came to be its own reward. Stoicism ascended to a sublime morality, ideals 
				never since transcended by any purely human system of philosophy. While the Stoics professed to be the &quot;offspring 
				of God,&quot; they failed to know him and therefore failed to find him. Stoicism remained a philosophy; 
				it never became a religion. Its followers sought to attune their minds to the harmony of the Universal Mind, 
				but they failed to envisage themselves as the children of a loving Father. Paul leaned heavily toward Stoicism 
				when he wrote, &quot;I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content.&quot;</td>

				<td class="algn-right-top-bld" style="width: 157px">The Cynic</td>
				<td class="quotation">Although the Cynics traced their philosophy to Diogenes of Athens, they derived much 
				of their doctrine from the remnants of the teachings of Machiventa Melchizedek. Cynicism had formerly been 
				more of a religion than a philosophy. At least the Cynics made their religio-philosophy democratic. In the 
				fields and in the market places they continually preached their doctrine that &quot;man could save himself 
				if he would.&quot; They preached simplicity and virtue and urged men to meet death fearlessly. These wandering 
				Cynic preachers did much to prepare the spiritually hungry populace for the later Christian missionaries. 
				Their plan of popular preaching was much after the pattern, and in accordance with the style, of Paul&#39;s 
				Epistles.</td>
