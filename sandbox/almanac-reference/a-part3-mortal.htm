				and the disruption of the teaching regime. Except for the work of Van, the influence of the Dalamatian revelation 
				was practically lost to the whole world. Even the Nodites had forgotten this truth by the time of Adam’s

				truths have never been entirely lost to the world. The entire trend of Levantine religious evolution was

				the attainment of the Universal Father can ever be complete. All other celestial ministrations are no more 
				than partial, transient, and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space. While such admissions

				influence and authority of this, the most recent of the revelations of truth to the mortal races of Urantia.</td>
