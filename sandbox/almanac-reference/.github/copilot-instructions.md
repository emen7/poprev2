# Master Universe Almanac Project Instructions

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing to the Master Universe Almanac modernization project, which combines the existing almanac with a new Urantia Book text reader experience.

## Project Overview

The Master Universe Almanac serves as a specialized reference resource for students of the Urantia Book. This modernization effort transforms the existing reference tool (masteruniverse.org) into a contemporary digital resource while preserving its valuable content.

### Core Objectives

- Improve readability across all devices
- Create a responsive design that works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices
- Enhance user experience for students and researchers
- Integrate almanac reference materials with a Urantia Book reader
- Replace current HTML page references with an integrated UB Reader


## Repository Structure

The project uses a **monorepo approach** to house all components, ensuring tight integration between the Almanac and the Urantia Book Reader.

### Monorepo Benefits

- Unified versioning across all components
- Simplified code sharing between Almanac and Reader
- Atomic commits for changes spanning multiple components
- Streamlined cross-component refactoring
- Single source of truth for the entire codebase


### Repository Organization

```

```


### Performance Optimizations

- Use Git LFS for large media files (audio content)
- Implement sparse checkouts for working with specific parts of the codebase
- Maintain clean commit history through rebasing and atomic commits


## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React (functional components) with Next.js
- **Styling**: CSS Modules/Styled Components with Material Design elements
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Development Environment**: VS Code
- **Version Control**: GitHub (user: emen7)
- **Build System**: Turborepo for managing the monorepo build process


### Performance Optimization

- Implement lazy loading for non-critical resources
- Use code splitting to deliver code in smaller chunks
- Leverage server-side rendering for improved initial load times and SEO
- Optimize media assets for faster loading


## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use double quotes for JavaScript code
- Use tabs for indentation
- Include inline comments where appropriate
- Mark auto-generated code with a comment like "Generated by Copilot"
- Follow semantic HTML practices
- Implement proper ARIA labels for accessibility


### Component Structure

- Create modular, reusable components
- Follow the single responsibility principle
- Implement proper prop validation
- Use React hooks for state management
- Document component APIs with JSDoc comments


### Responsive Design

- Design mobile-first, then enhance for larger screens
- Ensure tables allow horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
- Break large datasets into modular sections or cards
- Test thoroughly on multiple device sizes (desktop, Android phones, iPads)


## Navigation and UI

### Core Navigation Features

- Implement a left-top-floating hamburger menu for quick internal links
- Create a floating settings icon with the following options:
    - Dark/light mode toggle (default to dark mode)
    - Progressive font size adjustments
- Ensure keyboard navigation support for accessibility


### Content Presentation

- Present datasets as "cards" on the main website
- Implement a consistent card design pattern
- Enable sharing functionality for specific reference materials
- Break large datasets into modular sections


## Urantia Book Reader Integration

### Core Reader Features

The Urantia Book Reader will serve as both an integrated component of the Almanac and a standalone reading application, replacing the current system of HTML page references.

#### Reading Experience

- Emulate Kindle-like features for a modern reading experience
- Implement text customization (size adjustment, font selection)
- Support light/dark theme toggle for comfortable reading in different environments
- Create a responsive layout that adapts to all device sizes


#### Annotation System

- Develop an auto-referencing note-taking feature that maintains context within the book's structure
- Implement highlighting capabilities for important passages
- Create a quote collection system for saving and organizing meaningful content
- Ensure annotations persist across sessions and devices


#### Audio Integration

- Integrate MP3 playback of pre-recorded audio content
- Implement browser-based text-to-speech functionality
- Synchronize text and audio content for seamless transitions


#### Reference System

- Create a bidirectional linking system between Almanac content and the Urantia Book
- Implement precise referencing to papers, sections, and paragraphs
- Support deep linking for sharing specific passages


### Technical Implementation

- Utilize the existing JSON-formatted content from the data repository
- Implement modular content loading for optimal performance
- Create a persistent state management system for user preferences and annotations
- Optimize for both online and offline reading experiences


## Content Management System (CMS)

### Backend CMS Interface

The project includes a non-public content management system to facilitate the creation and management of dataset cards. This system is accessible only to authorized content creators.

#### CMS Core Features

1. **Dataset Card Creation**
    - Structured forms for creating new dataset cards
    - Rich text editor with formatting options
    - Table builder using CSS Grid/Flexbox (not HTML tables)
    - Citation linking to Urantia Book passages through the integrated reader
2. **Content Organization**
    - Drag-and-drop interface for arranging cards
    - Hierarchical organization capabilities
    - Tagging system for cross-referencing
    - Bulk operations for multiple cards
3. **Navigation Management**
    - Automatic generation of site navigation based on content structure
    - Custom ordering of navigation items
    - Preview of navigation changes before publishing
4. **Publishing Workflow**
    - Draft/review/publish stages
    - Scheduled publishing
    - Version history and rollback capabilities
    - Preview functionality for different device sizes

#### CMS Technical Implementation

- Secure authentication for administrative access
- RESTful API for content operations
- Real-time validation and error checking
- Optimized database queries for performance


## Accessibility Standards

- Implement ARIA labels throughout the application
- Use semantic HTML structures
- Ensure keyboard navigation support
- Maintain appropriate color contrast ratios
- Support screen readers and assistive technologies
- Implement progressive enhancement principles
