		<br>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;Man's 

		increasing control--the

		Jesus' last visit with Gadiah had to do with a discussion of good

		suffer the sorrows of evil; after all, who creates evil?" It was still

		Jesus never taught such error. In answering this question, Jesus said: 

		"My brother, God is love; therefore he must be good, and his 

		<span class="quotation-red">goodness </span>is 

		so great and real that it cannot contain the small and unreal things of
