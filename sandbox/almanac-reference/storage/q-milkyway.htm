		visible to the naked eye on Urantia belong to the seventh section of the 
		grand universe, the superuniverse of Orvonton. The vast Milky Way starry 
		system represents the central nucleus of Orvonton, being largely beyond 
		the borders of your local universe. This great aggregation of suns, dark 
		islands of space, double stars, globular clusters, star clouds, spiral and 
		other nebulae, together with myriads of individual planets, forms a watchlike, 
		elongated-circular grouping of about one seventh of the inhabited evolutionary 
		universes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the astronomical position of 
		Urantia, as you look through the cross section of near-by systems to the 
		great Milky Way, you observe that the spheres of Orvonton are traveling 
		in a vast elongated plane, the breadth being far greater than the thickness 
		and the length far greater than the breadth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		Observation of the so-called Milky Way discloses the comparative increase 
		in Orvonton stellar density when the heavens are viewed in one direction, 
		while on either side the density diminishes; the number of stars and other 
		spheres decreases away from the chief plane of our material superuniverse. 
		When the angle of observation is propitious, gazing through the main body 
		of this realm of maximum density, you are looking toward the residential 
		universe and the center of all things.</td>

		of vast numbers of former spiral and other nebulae, and many still retain 
		their original configuration. But as the result of internal catastrophes 
		and external attraction, many have suffered such distortion and rearrangement 
		as to cause these enormous aggregations to appear as gigantic luminous masses 
		of blazing suns, like the Magellanic Cloud. The globular type of star clusters 
		predominates near the outer margins of Orvonton.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		The vast star clouds of Orvonton should be regarded as individual aggregations 
		of matter comparable to the separate nebulae observable in the space regions 
		external to the Milky Way galaxy. Many of the so-called star clouds of space, 
		however, consist of gaseous material only. The energy potential of these 
		stellar gas clouds is unbelievably enormous, and some of it is taken up 
		by near-by suns and redispatched in space as solar emanations.</td>
