		The source of universe reality is the Infinite. The material things of finite creation are 

		the time-space repercussions of the Paradise Pattern and the Universal Mind of the eternal 

		God. Causation in the physical world, self-consciousness in the intellectual world, and 

		progressing selfhood in the spirit world—these realities, projected on a universal scale, 

		combined in eternal relatedness, and experienced with perfection of quality and divinity of 

		value—constitute the reality of the Supreme. But in an ever-changing universe the Original 

		Personality of causation, intelligence, and spirit experience is changeless, absolute. All 

		things, even in an eternal universe of limitless values and divine qualities, may, and 

		oftentimes do, change except the Absolutes and that which has attained the physical status, 

		intellectual embrace, or spiritual identity which is absolute.</td>
